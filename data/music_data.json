As they get to the door, they soon realize they have to sing a song to get past.\n\nAt the beginning of the song, everything is fine, but as it goes on, Marceline sings “I’m just your problem” to Bubblegum, angry because she thinks Bubblegum doesn’t like her anymore. This song also refers to Bubblegum and Marceline’s supposed relationship. As Marceline sings, the door begins to open, yet it closes as her voice begins to falter. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Adventure+Time/_/I%27m+Just+Your+Problem+(feat.+Olivia+Olson)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "There are several artists with this name:\n\n1) Ado (born October 24, 2002 in Tokyo, Japan) is a Japanese singer and Utaite and is often considered to be one of the most promising and popular young singers in Japan. In 2020, at the age of 17, she made her debut with the digital single titled Usseewa. The song peaked at number 1 on Billboard Japan Hot 100, Oricon Digital Singles Chart, Oricon Streaming Chart, and Spotify Viral 50 Japan. The music video of the song on her YouTube channel reached 100 million views in 148 days after its release. Reaching 100 million plays on Billboard Japan after 17 weeks from charting-in was the sixth fastest in history and the youngest for a solo singer.\n\nDespite the popularity of her debut song and singles shortly after it, she has always remained anonymous in public and still to this day, her face is still mostly unknown. She has been an Utaite (mostly anonymous cover artists) and a fan of Hatsune Miku and other Vocaloids throughout her life which could be assumed to be a reason why alongside simple privacy reasons. \n\n2022 is regarded as a very significant year in her career. She released her first two Albums: Kyogen (January 2022) and the album dedicated to One Piece: Film Red (August 2022 / More info down below), getting to create two theme songs for the Live Action Movie, \"Karada Sagashi\" as well as having live performances and other collaborations and events throughout the year. \n\nIn the Summer of 2022, She played a major role in the movie One Piece: Film Red for the very popular anime series One Piece as she released an album dedicated to the movie.  The Album was a big success and appeared everywhere on domestic musical charts and broke numerous records throughout the process. Notably, every song in the album all individually placed very highly on every Japanese musical chart including Spotify, Billboard and Apple Music. the very latter of which saw her have seven songs take up the top seven spots on August 14th. Impressively, she is the only Japanese Artist in history to occupy all the top 5 spots on a musical chart with songs from the same album. \n\nIn 2023, Ado continued releasing singles, released her third album as well as  the announcement of her first world tour. Notable singles this year include \"Show\" and \"Kura Kura\". The former quickly solidifying itself as one of her most popular songs with the latter being used as the opening song for the anime \"Spy x Family\", becoming her first TV anime opening. \n\nHer third album, \"Ado's Utattemita Album\" was released in December of 2023 which is a cover album featuring various Vocaloid and J-pop songs, which fans voted on for her to cover.\n\n\n--\n2) Adolfo Makuntima Makwiza (aka Ado and  Ado Makuntima) contributed to the African music scene in Toronto for over ten years. In fact, he was the first African-Canadian to found an African musical group there. Although he admitted that it's challenging to live as an artist in Canada, he had won support across the country, mostly from African music lovers seeking another opportunity to put on their dancing shoes.\n\nDespite social, political and economic difficulties in the Democratic Republic of Congo, dance and celebration are central to emotional expression. Thus, it comes as no surprise that Ado knew how to enjoy life and that his music is a reflection of it. The hip-swinging rhythms and electrifying guitar of African rumba and Soukous define his classic Congolese style.\n\nHe died on Dec 29th, 2017 of a heart attack.\n--\n3) A Chinese rock group consisting of members of the University of Beijing, their album \"I Say What I Mean\" 我不能隨便說 was re-released in 1996.\n--\n4) Adnan Covic Ado, a singer from Bosnia and Herzegovina. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ado\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lagerquist Senior Public School, and then Heart Lake Secondary School until grade nine, but then completed high school through correspondence.[2] His first role was an unpaid appearance in a Tim Hortons summer camp commercial.[2][5][6] He divides his time between Ontario and Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2002, Cera played the young Chuck Barris in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and provided the voice for Brother Bear in The Berenstain Bears animated series; he also voiced Josh Spitz in the cartoon Braceface. He played George Michael Bluth in the award-winning television series Arrested Development for three seasons before it was canceled.[7] In 2005, he starred as Harold in the award winning surreal humour short film Darling Darling, for which he was awarded Best Actor at the San Gio Festival in Verona, Italy. In 2006, he created and starred in a parody of Impossible is Nothing, a video résumé created by Aleksey Vayner.[8] He also guest-starred in an episode of teen noir drama Veronica Mars (in the episode \"The Rapes of Graff\", which also featured Arrested Development co-star Alia Shawkat), and also in the Adult Swim series Tom Goes to the Mayor and Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\n\nCera, along with best friend Clark Duke, wrote and starred in a series of short videos released on their website.[7] In 2007, they signed a deal with CBS Television to write, produce, direct, and act in a short-form comedy series entitled Clark and Michael.[9] The show featured guest stars such as David Cross, Andy Richter and Patton Oswalt, and was distributed via CBS's new internet channel, CBS Innertube.[10] Duke and Cera are both members of the band The Long Goodbye.\n\nCera also appeared in a staged comedy video that shows Cera being fired from the lead role of the film Knocked Up after belittling and arguing with the director, in a scene that mocks the David O. Russell blow up on the set of I Heart Huckabees.[7] Other clips featured movie stars James Franco and Orlando Bloom in a similar situation.\n\nCera starred alongside Jonah Hill in the film Superbad, which was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. The film opened in North America on August 17, 2007, with Cera playing a character named Evan. In November 2007, Cera hosted Saturday Night Live on strike, a live staged version of SNL not shown on television due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America Strike.[11] Also in 2007, Cera co-starred in Juno (written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman), playing Paulie Bleeker, who unexpectedly impregnates his long time teenage friend Juno (Elliot Page). Juno also starred Arrested Development co-star Jason Bateman. For Superbad and Juno, Cera won Breakthrough Artist in the Austin Film Critics Association Awards 2007.\n\nIn early 2008, Cera appeared in the comedy short \"Drunk History\", playing Alexander Hamilton in a comedic retelling of Hamilton's duel with Aaron Burr.[12] Cera will next star in film adaptations of the novels Youth in Revolt (playing lead character Nick Twisp)[13][7] and Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, opposite Kat Dennings.[14] He will also appear as the titular character in graphic novel adaptation Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.[15]\n\nIn August 2014, Michael Cera released an album of lo-fi bedroom recordings on Bandcamp. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Cera\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "True That (stylised as true that) is the debut album by Canadian actor and musician Michael Cera. It was self-released on August 8, 2014 via Bandcamp, and recorded and mixed by Cera. \nThe album has garnered positive reviews from music critics, with many comparing it to the work of Elliott Smith and other indie folk artists. However, some critics have expressed reservations about the album's length across 21 tracks. Amy Zimmerman of The Daily Beast gave the album a positive review, stating \"a mix of instrumental tracks, lovely ballads and solemn covers, true that is music to make sweet, twee love to... The sound is all melancholy, alternative, and adorable\". On the other hand, Zimmerman felt that the album seemed \"almost infinite\" due to its full length of over 50 minutes. Vulture.com's Jesse David Fox cited the album's \"pleasant instrumentals\"; he compared the overall effect to the works of Cass McCombs, Jason Schwartzman's band Coconut Records, and Elliott Smith, as well as Paul and Linda McCartney's first album, Ram. 7BitArcade's Aaron Kent praised Cera's \"wistful vocals\", describing them \"a broken Elliott Smith trying to channel Beck\". Chris DeVille of Stereogum called true that \"a charming listen\", adding that \"ts lo-fi folk songs and jazzy piano ditties remind me — in spirit, at least — of Badly Drawn Boy’s threadbare debut The Hour of Bewilderbeast\".\n\nRyan Reed of Rolling Stone chose \"Too Much\", \"2048\" and \"Clay Pigeons\" as three of the album's highlights.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Cera/true+that\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Christopher Alvin Stapleton[2] (born April 15, 1978) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist.  Stapleton's music styles include Southern rock and bluegrass. He is an established songwriter with six country number-one songs including the five-week number-one \"Never Wanted Nothing More\" recorded by Kenny Chesney, \"Love's Gonna Make It Alright\" recorded by George Strait, and \"Come Back Song\" recorded by Darius Rucker. Over 150 of Stapleton's songs have appeared on albums by such artists as Adele, Luke Bryan, Tim McGraw, Brad Paisley and Dierks Bentley. Among other artists, he has co-written with Vince Gill, Peter Frampton and Sheryl Crow.\n\nAfter serving as the frontman of bluegrass group The SteelDrivers from 2008 to 2010, Stapleton released his debut studio album Traveller in 2015, which reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Among several accolades, he won the Country Music Association Awards and the Academy of Country Music Awards for Album of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year, and the Grammy Award for Best Country Album and Best Country Solo Performance at the 58th annual ceremony. His second studio album, From A Room: Volume 1 was released on May 5, 2017,  reached number two on the US Billboard 200, and to date has surpassed 500,000 units sold. Six months later, Stapleton released follow-up album, From A Room: Volume 2, which, like its predecessor, debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200. \n\nStapleton was born in a Lexington, Kentucky hospital. His mother worked at the local health department and his father was a coal miner. He comes from a family of coal miners.[12][13] He has an older brother and younger sister.[14][15]\n\nStapleton grew up in the small town of Staffordsville, Kentucky, which is located just outside of Paintsville, located between the city and the Paintsville lake. He graduated from Johnson Central High School where he was his class valedictorian and attended Vanderbilt University where he studied engineering, but dropped out after a year.\n\nStapleton is married to singer-songwriter Morgane Hayes, who co-wrote Carrie Underwood's 2006 single \"Don't Forget to Remember Me\". She had a recording deal with Arista Nashville. The couple met when they were working at adjacent publishing houses. They have two children and live in Nashville. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Stapleton\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by Kevin Welch in 2002, and soul singer Solomon Burke included it on his 2006 country music tribute album Nashville.\n\nThe song was released as a promotional single of Volume 2 on October 20, 2017, and was released to country radio as the album's first single on April 23, 2018.\n\n\"Millionaire\" is a mid-tempo soul-influenced heartland rock and country rock ballad driven by acoustic guitar. Lyrically, the song is about \"spare love\" and appreciating relationship closeness over material wealth. Stapleton sings on the chorus accompanied by his wife and collaborator, Morgane.\n\nThe song is composed in the key of B-flat major with a slow tempo. It primarily follows the chord pattern B♭5-F5-E♭add9-B♭5-E♭add9-B♭5\n\nRobert Crawford of Rolling Stone said the song \"gets a swinging, Heartbreakers-worthy update by Stapleton and company,\" and considered Morgane's harmonies as \"the song's secret weapon\" which \"trace her husband's melodies at every twist and turn.\" Ari Shapiro of NPR felt Stapleton's reading of \"Millionaire\" \"has a laidback, Petty-esque jangle and, thanks to the Stapletons' cozy harmonizing throughout, a feeling of equanimity.\"\n\nOn December 4, 2017, Stapleton performed \"Millionaire\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and on December 6 on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Stapleton/_/Millionaire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Turnstile is heavily influenced by NYHC bands such as Madball and Breakdown, and also incorporate elements of 90s alternative metal and alternative rock, grunge revival, 60s soul and r&b music, and art rock, and has a very distinct, groovy sound. The band is currently signed to Reaper Records and has two EP releases out: Pressure to Succeed (2011) and Step 2 Rhythm (2013). In 2012 they were featured on the Extermination EP among other hardcore/metal acts such as Suburban Scum.

For those who insist American punk is dead, “MYSTERY” is an undeniable rebuttal that proves the genre continues to thrive and evolve beyond its boundaries. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Turnstile/_/MYSTERY\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Michael Steven Bublé (born 9 September 1975 in Burnaby, British Columbia) is a Canadian singer and actor. He has won several awards, including three Grammy Awards and multiple Juno Awards. His first album reached the top ten in the United Kingdom and his home country of Canada. He found worldwide commercial success with his 2005 album It's Time, and his 2007 album Call Me Irresponsible was an even bigger success, reaching number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and the European charts. Bublé's fifth studio album, Christmas, was released on October 24, 2011 in the United Kingdom] and October 25, 2011 in the United States. The Cold December Night Songfacts states it was produced by David Foster, Bob Rock and Humberto Gatica. The album was recorded primarily at Capitol Recording Studios in Hollywood and The Warehouse Studios in Vancouver during July.\n\nMichael Bublé’s introduction to the music of the swing era came to him through his grandfather, who filled his grandson’s ears with the sounds of The Mills Brothers, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, and others. As Bublé eagerly absorbed the recordings, he began to realize that he wanted to be a singer and that this style of music, virtually foreign to his own generation, was what he wanted to perform.\n\nWith his grandfather’s assistance, Bublé soon learned a whole catalog of tunes and gained experience and exposure by singing as a guest with several local bands. While still in his teen years, he won the Canadian Youth Talent Search, released several independent albums, and performed in a musical review titled Swing that traveled across the U.S. It wasn’t long before Bublé was introduced to Grammy-winning producer David Foster during a famous Canadian wedding of Brian Mulroney’s daughter Caroline Mulroney. He later signed his first major recording contract with Reprise Records after that encounter.\n\nThe two Canadians began work on a debut album that would incorporate Bublé’s aptitude for pop standards into songs that spanned several decades. His self-titled debut disc was released in early 2003, and featured jazzy takes on old standards like “Fever” and “The Way You Look Tonight” as well as newer classics like “Moondance” and “How Can You Mend A Broken Heart”.\n\nHe finished off 2003 with an EP of holiday material, Let It Snow, and began 2004 with the live CD/DVD set Come Fly With Me. In 2005, It’s Time was a number one hit in Canada, Japan, Italy, and Australia, and made the top ten of both the UK and US. Later that year he released the live album Caught in the Act. More recently, Michael received a 2010 Grammy Award for 'Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album' for 'Michael Bublé Meets Madison Square Garden. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Michael+Bubl%C3%A9\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Christmas also sold 479,000 copies in the album's third week at No. 1, which marked Bublé's best sales week ever. On the album's tenth week on the album charts, and with Christmas having passed, the album fell to No. 24 on January 14, 2012.

It sold 1,292,000 copies in the UK in 2011, making it the second best-selling album of 2011.

The album was released in the United Kingdom on April 15, 2013, before being issued in Canada  on April 22 and the United States on April 23. The album was preceded by the release of the lead single, the original composition It's A Beautiful Day, released on February 25, 2013. \n\nThe album was produced by Bob Rock and recorded in Vancouver, Canada and Los Angeles.\nThe album includes 10 standards and 4 original songs all co-written by Bublé, Bob Rock, Alan Chang and Amy Foster-Gillies. The album also features appearances from actress Reese Witherspoon on \" Something Stupid\", Naturally 7 and The Puppini Sisters and includes covers of songs such as the Bee Gees's \" To Love Somebody\", Dean Martin's \" Nevertheless (I'm in love with you)\", the Miracles's \" Who's Loving You\", Jackie Wilson's \" To Be Loved\", and Elvis Presley's \" Have I Told You Lately\".\n\nIn Bublé's opinion, this is the best record's he's ever made, as he said on his website “I think it’s the best album I’ve ever made…I know every artist on earth says that when their new album is coming out but really - this time it’s true. I swear.\" He also added : \"Trust me, there’s no sitting back, no dialing in for me. I labored over every song, every note and every arrangement because I can’t resist trying to make each record better than my last one. It helps that I’m pretty happy in my life at the moment and feel that I’ve really grown a lot as a songwriter and interpreter of great songs. On “To Be Loved” I felt a new sense of freedom to create and kind of take things further – maybe take a few risks and dig deep to find some gems.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Bubl%C3%A9/To+Be+Loved\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "\n\nLove (stylized as the red heart emoji ❤️ is the tenth studio album and eighth major label studio album by Canadian singer Michael Bublé, released on November 16, 2018, by Reprise Records.It is supported by the lead single \"When I Fall in Love\".\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Bublé was quoted as saying that Love would be his final album and that he would no longer do interviews, as his son's cancer diagnosis and subsequent remission made him re-evaluate what was important to him, and that as he has made \"the perfect album\", he can retire from music \"at the very top\".His management subsequently dismissed these as \"tabloid\" rumours, denying that Bublé would be retiring.\n\nLove is Bublé's first release of any kind in two years, following his eldest son Noah being diagnosed with liver cancer, which he has said made him consider \"never returning to music\". He later returned to write and record songs in the studio as his son's condition improved. On his approach to the album, Bublé stated: \"My end game for the new record was to create a series of short cinematic stories for each song I chose and have it stand on its own.\" Once the rough outline of his album concept was formed he pitched the idea to his band members while they were visiting his Vancouver home for a casual jam session and video games.\n\nFor the album, Bublé wrote the original song \"Forever Now\", and co-wrote the track \"Love You Anymore\" with Charlie Puth. The singer coaxed his mentor David Foster out of retirement from studio projects to oversee projection of much of the album. Bublé originally thought he would title the album My Romance in reference to his rekindled romance with music, but decided against it because he felt the title would involve frequent contextual explanation.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Bubl%C3%A9/love+(Deluxe+Edition)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "This is the one original track on Michael Bublé's festive album \"Christmas\". The Canadian crooner penned the song with his longtime co-writer Alan Chang.\n\n\"Christmas\" was produced by David Foster, Bob Rock and Humberto Gatica. It was recorded primarily at Capitol Recording Studios in Hollywood and The Warehouse Studios in Vancouver. Said Bublé: \"Christmas has always been my favorite time of the year for me and my family so naturally it's been a dream of mine to make the 'ultimate' Christmas record. Even though it was summer and 95 degrees in LA, we totally got into the spirit of the holiday. Of course we decorated the studio with Christmas lights in the middle of July and that was a big help. One more thing, my mother told me it's the best record I ever made.\"\n\nThe album is Bublé's second Christmas-themed release. In 2003 he released a five-track EP entitled \"Let It Snow\".\n\nThe \"Christmas\" LP spent four weeks at #1 on the Billboard 200 and sold 2,452,000 copies in the US in 2011. It was the second best-selling album of the year behind Adele's \"21\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Bubl%C3%A9/_/Cold+December+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "name": "The La's",
        "bio": "The La's are a rock band which formed in 1984 in Liverpool, England. The band's lineup constantly changed, with its only constant members being Lee Mavers (vocals, guitar) and John Power (bass). In 1990, the band released their only album, The La's, which contained four singles. There She Goes made #13 in the UK, #49 in the US and #2 on the US Modern Rock chart and was extremely influential on the later britpop genre.\n\nThe La's formed in 1984, with original member Mike Badger stating that the band name occurred to him in a dream, as well as it being Scouse for \"lads\", and having obvious musical connotations. The band existed briefly as an arthouse/skiffle-type outfit with a few tracks released on local compilations. Lee Mavers joined in 1984 as rhythm guitarist, eventually gaining songwriting prominence and emerging as the band's enduring figurehead. Longtime bassist John Power joined the group in 1986, having met Badger on a local council-run musicianship course. Badger however left the group in late 1986, to form The Onset.\n\nThe band attracted the attention of several record labels after a series of performances in their home town in 1986, and demo tapes copied from a session at the Flying Picket rehearsal studio in Liverpool began circulating. One of these demo tapes was sent to Underground Magazine. A journalist there with the task of reviewing unsigned bands gave the cassette to Andy McDonald at Go! Discs. Several record labels later became interested in signing the band. The band chose to sign with Go! Discs.\n\nThe band's first single Way Out was mixed with producer Gavin MacKillop. When it was released in October 1987, it broke in to the top 100 and was praised by The Smiths' frontman Morrissey in the music magazine Melody Maker, but attracted little notice. The band continued to perform around the UK and gained success as a live act, drawing comparisons to The Beatles due to their origins, vaguely Merseybeat sound, and Mavers' expressive lyrics.\n\nThere She Goes was released in 1988 with the B-sides \"Come In Come Out\" and \"Who Knows\". The song garnered moderate attention and airplay, but performed poorly in the charts. The music video for \"There She Goes\" features The La's scampering through run-down Liverpool streets and was filmed in an afternoon on a handheld camera. It was later re-released a number of times, the earliest being 1990's Steve Lillywhite mix. After working with producer Jeremy Allom at the Pink Museum Studio in Liverpool in May 1989, the band were set to release \"Timeless Melody\" as a single. While test pressings had been sent out for review, and was nominated for \"record of the week\" in the NME, Mavers was reportedly unhappy with the production and the single release was scrapped.\n\nThe La's then spent two years fruitlessly recording and re-recording their intended album, with a constantly changing band lineup, where only the core of Mavers and Power remained the same. Discarded producers included The Smiths' producer John Porter, as well as John Leckie and Mike Hedges. Both Leckie and Hedges in interviews have been very complimentary about the band's songs and their respective sessions.\n\nThe previously volatile band lineup settled in 1989 with Lee's brother, Neil Mavers on drums, and Peter \"Cammy\" Camell as lead guitarist. The group then entered London's Eden Studios in December 1989 to again record their debut album with Simple Minds and U2 producer Steve Lillywhite. Despite this lineup being arguably the most stable, and press interviews from the time painting them as extremely confident, the sessions still did not satisfy Mavers. In one instance Mavers was reported to have rejected a vintage mixing desk, claiming it did not have the right sound because \"it hasn't got original Sixties dust on it\" although this claim has since been revealed as apocryphal. The Eden sessions with Lillywhite would become the band's final attempt at recording the album. The frustration of not achieving the right sound and mood in their songs, as well as increasing friction with Go! Discs, who had spent a considerable sum of money on recording sessions for the album, led to them simply giving up on the sessions. Lillywhite pieced together the recordings he had made with the group into what became the eventually released album. The band, particularly Lee Mavers, were not pleased with this decision.\n\nAmong the band's complaints were that Lillywhite used vocal guide tracks on the LP and that he did not \"understand\" their sound. Mavers would later go on to claim that the band had played poorly deliberately during the sessions in the hope that the material would not be released, as they did not gel with Lillywhite from day one.\n\nHowever, recognition, at least critically, came for The La's in 1990 when the self-titled album, The La's, was released. The album reached #30 in the UK charts and received a Silver certification, but the album did not fare as well overseas. The album only reached #196 on the Billboard 200 and to date has sold fewer than 50,000 copies in the U.S.\n\nThe album included, among new material, re-recorded versions of all the previous singles, including a remixed version of \"There She Goes\" which was then re-released as a single. This time around, the song reached number 13 in the UK singles chart and remains the most visible and enduring of all the band's songs.\n\nAdditional singles from the album included the LP versions of Timeless Melody and Feelin'. Both sold reasonably well, reaching chart placings around the top 40. A short promotional tour proceeded, accompanied by television appearances on shows such as Top of the Pops. Press interviews conducted during this period were generally confused in tone, owing to the fact the critics generally adored the album yet Mavers was assuring journalists that he \"hated\" the album and it was \"like a snake with a broken back\".\n\n1991 promotional tour dates were fulfilled in the UK and Europe including a few festivals, a well-received US tour. Bassist John Power left the group on the 13 December 1991, frustrated with having played essentially the same set of songs since 1986, and resurfaced a year later with his band Cast. The remainder of the 1991 concerts were performed with James Joyce on bass as well as a handful of 1992 dates. The band stopped touring and rehearsing in 1992 until further short-lived reunions, with various line-ups, throughout the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nThe band disbanded in 1992, with Mavers restarting the band various times in the years since (one between 1994 and 1996 and again in 2005). The band reunited in June 2011 as a duo consisting of Mavers and bassist Gary Murphy. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+La%27s\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "\"The La's\" is the only studio album by English rock band the La's, released on 1 October 1990 by Go! Discs. It included \"There She Goes\", the group's biggest hit, and \"Timeless Melody\". A deluxe edition of The La's was released on 7 April 2008. In 2013, NME ranked The La's at number 153 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nAll of the songs on \"The La's\" were written by Lee Mavers between 1986 and 1987 and after signing to Go! Discs in 1987 and for the next three years, the La's worked with several producers to record their debut album, including John Porter, Gavin MacKillop, John Leckie, Bob Andrews, Jeremy Allom and Mike Hedges. The final sessions for the album were recorded December 1989 – February 1990 at Eden Studios in London with producers Steve Lillywhite and Mark Wallis. \"There She Goes\" is a remixed version of the original single recording produced by Bob Andrews in 1988. The La's first single song, Way Out, was re-recorded for the album.\n\nAccording to the liner notes in the Deluxe edition from 2008, The La's did 12 different sessions between July 1987 and May 1990.\n\nIn July 1987, Matrix studio, London, John Porter produced \"Doledrum\", \"Son of a Gun\", \"Failure\" and \"Jams\". \"Doledrum\" appears on the deluxe edition.\n\nIn August–September 1987, Townhouse studio, London, Gavin McKillop produced \"Way Out\", \"Endless\" and \"Knock Me Down\"In October 1987, Ezee Studios, London, Dave Allen produced Doledrum, still unreleased.\n\nIn October 1987, Fall out shelter, London, Andy MacDonald produced a remixed \"Way out\" single. Three Versions were mixed; \"Way Out (New Version)\", appeared on the 7\" EP Version of \"There She Goes\" in November 1988. \"Way Out (mix 2)\" appears on the Deluxe Edition. The third version being an unreleased instrumental mix.\n\nIn March/April 1988, at Abbey Road, London/Jam recordings/Chipping Norton, John Leckie produced \"Doledrum\", \"Man I'm Only Human\", \"There She Goes\", \"Feelin'\", \"Come In Come Out\". A slightly edited/remixed Version of \"Feelin'\" appeared as the alternate Version on the b-side of the \"Feelin'\" single in February 1991. \"There She Goes\" and \"Man I'm Only Human\" appear on the Deluxe Edition.\n\nIn July/September 1988, Woodcray Studios, Workingham/Red Bus, London (mixing), Bob Andrews produced 14 tracks incl the original single version of \"There She Goes\" and the b-sides; \"Come In Come Out\", \"Who Knows\" and \"Man I'm Only Human\". \"Feelin'\" and \"Clean Prophet\" appear on the Deluxe Edition.\n\nIn December 1988/January 1989 at Attic Studios, Liverpool, The La's produced an aborted session.\n\nIn January 1989, Pink Museum, Liverpool, Mike Haas, Andy MacDonald and Hambi produced \"Timeless Melody\" and \"Clean Prophet\", still unreleased.\n\nIn February/April 1989, Pink Museum, Liverpool, The La's and Jeremy Allom produced 8 tracks.

In May 1990, Townhouse studio, London, Steve Lillywhite produced 6 tracks in a mixing session for the album.\n\nThe album released is largely from the Steve Lillywhite sessions, although some backing vocals appear to be from the Hedges sessions, something Lee Mavers complained about on Rapido TV.\n\n\"The La's\" was released in 1990 on Go! Discs in the United Kingdom and in 1991 on London Records in the United States. The album was praised by critics and embraced by fans. It was the result of nearly three years in the studio with a string of acclaimed producers. Each attempted to capture the sound sought by Lee Mavers, the lead singer and principal songwriter of the band. However, due to Mavers' exacting expectations, the sound eluded each of the producers, and the album eventually released was immediately disowned by the band.\n\nA new version of the album, recorded by Mike Hedges (who has also worked with U2, Manic Street Preachers and the Cure) was found on a cassette; this new version was digitally remastered and released for the first time as part of \"The La's: Deluxe Edition\". This edition also includes previously unreleased archive recordings and radio sessions by the band, as well as deluxe packaging and expanded sleevenotes.\n\nIn 2013, NME ranked \"The La's\" at number 153 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2016, Rolling Stone placed the record at number 13 on its list of the \"40 Greatest One-Album Wonders\". \"The La's\" was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". Noel Gallagher of Oasis named it as one of his 13 favourite albums. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+La%27s/The+La%27s\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

First released as a single in 1988, the song reached number 13 on the UK Singles Chart when it was re-issued in 1990. In May 2007 NME magazine placed the song at number 45 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. \n\nThis song has been covered by several bands and two versions can be found (the La's and one by Boo Radleys) on the soundtrack to the movie \"So I married an Axe Murderer\"\n\nAccording to the There She Goes Songfacts, the common knowledge that this song is about heroin seems to be a sure bet. \"Racing through my brain\" and \"Pulsing through my vein\" exclude just about everything else, and newspapers in England ran stories about The La's \"ode to heroin.\" La's bassist John Power gave a rather evasive answer when asked about it, while La's ex-guitarist Paul Hemmings flatly denied it. \n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+La%27s/_/There+She+Goes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Chicago rapper/producer Saba first caught the attention of listeners as a frequent collaborator of Chance the Rapper. Saba's contributions to Chance songs like 2013's \"Everybody's Something\" and 2015's \"Angels\" showcased his range as both a rapper and vocalist and paved the way for his introspective debut studio album, Bucket List Project, in 2016. The loss of a close family member inspired 2018's Care for Me, a tragically beautiful album that explored death, mourning, and life after losing a loved one.\n\nSaba (Tahj Malik Chandler) grew up on the West Side of Chicago, specifically within the Austin neighborhood, as part of a deeply musical family. That's also where he formed Pivot Gang, a group of longtime associates that has featured, among others, his brother Jerrel (aka Joseph Chilliams), cousin Walter Long (aka John Walt), Logan Yutters (aka MFn Melo), Frsh Waters, and DJ Damnage. Saba recorded several solo mixtapes -- his first were issued while he was an introverted high-schooler -- and gained traction with ComfortZone, a 2014 release inspired by his father's neo-soul recordings that capitalized on his contributions to awareness-raising tracks by fellow Chicagoans Chance the Rapper and Mick Jenkins. In 2015, Saba appeared as featured artist on several cuts, including Chance's \"Angels,\" Jenkins' \"Slumber,\" and Odd Couple's \"What Kings Do.\" Additionally, he released the reflective Tink collaboration \"Temporary,\" one of his most commercial songs to date.\n\nIn late 2016, Saba self-released the LP Bucket List Project, featuring artists like fellow Chicagoan rappers Noname and Twista. In February of 2017, Saba's cousin, mentor, and Pivot Gang collaborator Walter Long was violently murdered by a stranger. Saba reflected on the scars left by this horrible loss throughout his second album,  CARE FOR ME, which was released in April of 2018. The vulnerable and emotionally complex album broke through with critics and took Saba's music to new audiences. He followed in November of that year with \"Beautiful Smile,\" a collaborative single with Maryland rapper IDK. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Saba\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He adopts more mellow, R&B-infused tones to talk about acceptance, self-discovery and reaching happiness. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Saba/Few+Good+Things\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Thomas Earl Petty (20 October 1950 - 2 October 2017) was an American musician, singer, composer and songwriter best known for fronting Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Apart from the band, he released three solo albums: \"Full Moon Fever\" (1989), \"Wildflowers\" (1994) and \"Highway Companion\" (2006). \n \nAfter working with his early bands The Sundowners, The Epics, and Mudcrutch (which also included future Heartbreakers members Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench) he began his recording career with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers when the band broke onto the national music scene with their 1976 self-titled debut album. Still, it took America a full year to catch up to the album. \"Breakdown\" was re-released to radio and became a Top 40 hit in 1977 after word filtered back the band was creating a firestorm in England. \nHe was also a member of The Traveling Wilburys, along with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison. Petty and the Heartbreakers also toured as a backing band for Bob Dylan.\n\nPetty is a vocal critic of the modern recording industry, including the disintegration of independent radio stations.\n\nPetty has been supported by his band, The Heartbreakers, for the majority of his career. He has occasionally released solo work, as is the case with his 2006 effort, Highway Companion, on which he performed most of the backing instrumentation himself. Examples of other solo albums include Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers\n\nPetty died on 2 October 2017 following a cardiac episode earlier that day at his home in Malibu, California. Although some media outlets incorrectly reported his death following an erroneous police report, his death was confirmed later that day by his publicist and manager. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Petty\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Damn the Torpedoes is the third album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released in 1979 by MCA Records. It was released to commercial success and critical acclaim becoming the band's breakthrough album. In 2003, the album was ranked number 313 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nDamn the Torpedoes was the Heartbreakers first for MCA Records. Their old label, Shelter, had been sold to MCA. Petty struggled to legally detach himself from MCA, resulting in his bankruptcy. In the end the record company backed down, and he negotiated a deal that allowed him to release his recordings on the new Backstreet Records label, manufactured and distributed by MCA. The album was recorded at Sound City in Van Nuys and Cherokee Studios in Hollywood. The title is a reference to a famous quote by Admiral David Farragut: \"Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!\".\n\nDamn the Torpedoes was released in October of 1979. The album was a breakthrough for Petty and the Heartbreakers. It was his first top 10 album rising to #2 hit (for seven weeks and kept from #1 by Pink Floyd's The Wall) on the Billboard's Albums chart. It yielded two songs that made the top-fifteen on the Billboard Hot 100  singles chart, \"Don't Do Me Like That\" (#10) and \"Refugee\" (#15). It was a commercial success as well. Thanks to the new co-producer Jimmy Iovine, Damn the Torpedoes proved to be a major leap forward in production. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Petty/Damn+the+Torpedoes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Promised for years prior to Tom Petty's untimely death in 2017, Wildflowers & All the Rest expands the rocker's beloved 1994 album Wildflowers into a comprehensive box, one filled with outtakes, demos, home recordings, and live performances. Petty originally delivered Wildflowers as a double-CD set to Warner Bros., but the label convinced him that it'd be easier to market a single disc, albeit one that ran the length of a double LP. Despite his acquiescence, the original uncut Wildflowers nagged at Petty, so he started to assemble a deluxe edition in the 2010s. It sadly didn't come to fruition until after his death, but Wildflowers & All the Rest does explain why the project stayed on his mind: there really was a wealth of good material left in the vault. A handful of these songs snuck out on the 1996 soundtrack to Edward Burns' romantic comedy She's the One (\"California,\" \"Hope You Never,\" \"Hung Up and Overdue, \"Climb That Hill,\" which is also present here as a solo acoustic blues), while Petty gave \"Leave Virginia Alone\" to Rod Stewart, so about half of the material is known to hardcore fans yet context means a lot here. Hearing these five songs with five excavated tracks alongside the original album confirms this was a purple patch for Petty, one where he was writing strong material executed with vigor by most of the Heartbreakers under the eye of Rick Rubin. With the notable exception of \"Somewhere Under Heaven,\" where trebly guitars race each other up the mountain, most of the unheard material here skews toward the slower, softer side, underscoring the homespun illusion of the proper album. While the released album benefits from its savvy sequencing, where rockers provide a bit of a lift on each side, everything on this supplementary disc is cut from the same cloth as Wildflowers; it accentuates the original album, it doesn't detract from it. Outside of the companion disc, Wildflowers & All the Rest delivers a collection of sturdy, direct home recordings and a robust live disc that collects concert performances of the songs scattered throughout the years. A super deluxe set running five CDs and nine LPs contains another disc of alternate versions; here, there's an alternate version of \"Girl on LSD,\" but the original B-side version of the song is oddly nowhere to be found on the box. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Petty/Wildflowers+&+All+The+Rest\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the US, it peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart.\n\nThe rock song was co-written by guitarist Mike Campbell, who was inspired by a motorcycle he owned. The musician told \"I was really into that frame of mind. This feels like a motorcycle shifting gears.\"\n\n\"Love Is a Long Road\" appears on the 2000 double-disc compilation album Anthology: Through the Years, as well as on the 1995 box set Playback.\n\nIn 2023, the song was used in the first trailer for the video game Grand Theft Auto VI. The trailer was viewed over 114 million times in two days and led to a 36,979% increase in streams on Spotify. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Petty/_/Love+Is+A+Long+Road\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Despite receiving favorable reviews, the album undersold expectations, charting at number 185 on the Billboard 200. The album's first single \"Little Things\" reached the top 30 on the Mainstream Top 40 and the Alternative Songs charts.\n\nThe band formed in 1995 with twin brothers Joel on vocals and Benji Madden on guitar, along with Billy Martin on guitar, Paul Thomas on bass and Aaron Escolopio on drums. A demo of \"Little Things\" received airplay from two radio stations and by early 2000, Good Charlotte had signed to Epic Records. Recording sessions with producer Don Gilmore for the debut album took place in four studios in California and New York.\n\nA music video for \"Little Things\" started getting airplay in November 2000. In March 2001, \"Little Things\" was released as a single, which was followed by a music video for \"The Motivation Proclamation\". Between March and May 2001, the group went on tour with MxPx and appeared at HFStival, where a music video for \"Festival Song\" was filmed. After this, Escolopio left the group and was replaced by Nate Foutz of Vroom. Foutz remained with the group for six weeks before Dusty Bill replaced him. The group participated in Warped Tour between June and August. Also in August, \"The Motivation Proclamation\" was released as a single and was followed by \"Festival Song\" in 2002. The album was subsequently certified silver in the UK and gold in the US. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Good+Charlotte/Good+Charlotte\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on October 27, 2010 through Capitol Records.\n\nWithin a year of releasing Good Morning Revival, Benji and Joel Madden had begun working on new material in early 2008. Pre-production started in early 2009 and tracking commenced in August with producer Howard Benson. Problems arose during this period; Benji Madden hesitated to work with Benson. Having completed the majority of the recording, Madden felt uncomfortable and realized the band was working with the wrong person after Benson removed two crucial verses from a track. After hearing rough mixes, Madden preferred the demo versions. Discussing this with producer Don Gilmore, he suggested the band start over in Vancouver, Canada. Following a meeting with the rest of the band, they relocated to Vancouver at the start of 2010. Recording sessions took place at the Armoury and Warehouse Studios before moving to Studio Can Am in Tarzana, California. Recording concluding in April 2010.\n\nFollowing recording, the group spent two months stint on the Bamboozle Road Show 2010 tour. After announcing it had signed to Capitol Records in July, the band toured Europe supporting Pink. \"Like It's Her Birthday\" was released as a single in August and was followed by a lyric video and a music video in September. 'Cardiology was released in November; a Like It's Her Birthday remix EP was released shortly afterwards. The track \"Sex on the Radio\" was released as a single in early 2011, after which the band headlined the Kerrang! Tour in the UK in February. At the tour's conclusion, \"Late Night\" was released as a single. A North-American headlining tour began in March and was promoted with a music video for \"Late Night\". It was followed-up in June with a co-headlining U.S. tour with Yellowcard. A music video for \"1979\" was released at the end of July and the song was released as a single at the start of August.\n\nCardiology returns to the pop punk sound of Good Charlotte's earlier releases while retaining some of its predecessor Good Morning Revival's electronic aspects. Most of the music was written by the Madden brothers while most of the lyrics were written by Benji Madden. Cardiology received a generally mixed reception from critics, garnering comments about the group's return-to-roots approach. It debuted at number 31 on the Billboard 200 and charted within the top 30 on five additional Billboard charts. As of September 2011, album sales stood at 52,000 copies. The album was successful in Australia, peaking at number three and later being certified gold. \"Like It's Her Birthday\", \"Sex on the Radio\" and \"Last Night\" all charted within the top 40, and were certified platinum in Australia. It charted within the top 30 in New Zealand, Switzerland and Austria, and had minor success in Canada, Germany, the UK and France.\" Like It's Her Birthday\" also had minor success in the US, charting on the Bubbling Under Hot 100, Mainstream Top 40 and Dance Club Songs charts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Good+Charlotte/Cardiology\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was released on September 14, 2018, through MDDN and BMG.\n\nGood Charlotte self-released their sixth album Youth Authority in July 2016, their first since they went on a hiatus in 2011. Vocalist Joel Madden felt that they had no momentum following their hiatus, and viewed Youth Authority as helping to rebuild it. Guitarist Benji Madden added that it served as a good restarting point for the band. They made the album as the members felt they had something to say after the years on hiatus. However, Joel Madden said it didn't completely embody what was going on in their headspace at the time. He went as far to add that two of the songs on it were there solely because they felt they had to include them.\n\nAt the start of 2018, the band were reflecting, having played at the memorial service for rapper Lil Peep earlier in December 2017. They covered Peep's \"Awful Things\" and later released it as a single. Benji Madden said, since the group would often follow their feelings and not focus on anything else, they became inspired to write a new record. The members discussed what they liked and disliked making Youth Authority, before taking into account what they felt their fans would want from them. After realizing their fans would want them to be honest, they decided to write material that was more organic and naturally felt good to them. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Good+Charlotte/Generation+Rx\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was a mildly successful single, with a music video that proudly sported all the pop-punk tropes of the time: black clothes, skating, performance videos and spiked hair. As the second single from the record, it was instrumental helping the band achieve a triple platinum certification in the US. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Good+Charlotte/_/The+Anthem\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Elsewhere, the single reached the top 40 in Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand.\n\nThe music video for the song predominantly shows geriatric people dressed and acting like young people. The various members of the band are shown interacting with the older characters (for example playing video games and giving massages). At the end of the video, Benji Madden wakes up to find an old woman wearing one of his shirts and offering him a bowl of cereal.\n\nThe video for \"Girls & Boys\" was shot in the suburb of Ellerslie in Auckland, New Zealand. The longer version includes dialogue of a senior woman and the band, a parodying reference to Avril Lavigne's video \"Complicated\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Good+Charlotte/_/Girls+&+Boys\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Rude\" is the debut single by Canadian band Magic! from their debut studio album, Don't Kill the Magic. It was originally released on October 11, 2013, as a promotional single and then re-released on February 24, 2014, by Sony Music Entertainment. The official remix for the song features Kid Ink and Ty Dolla Sign, with Travis Barker on the drums.\n\n\"Rude\" was an international commercial success amidst mixed reception from music critics. The song peaked at number six on the Canadian Hot 100 and internationally topped the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. \"Rude\" was the ninth best-selling song of 2014, with global sales of 8.6 million units, and won the Juno Award for Single of the Year.\n\n\"Rude\" was written by Nasri, Adam Messinger, Mark Pellizzer, Ben Spivak and Alex Tanas, and produced by Adam Messinger. According to the sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing at Musicnotes.com, \"Rude\" is a reggae fusion song set in common time with a tempo of 144 beats per minute. This song is written in the key of B♭ minor.\n\n\"Rude\" was named after the reggae term \"rude boy\" and originally based on a real-life situation. The lead singer of Magic!, Nasri, had been in an unhealthy relationship with a previous girlfriend. After the two of them got into a fight with each other, the band based the song off that headline. The couple was in a \"mean time\" when they were both being rude to each other, as Nasri says in what he describes as a \"dark vibe.\"\n\nThe music video features the band singing the song in a garage while scenes show Nasri in a relationship with a woman played by model Ayla Parker. After this, Nasri asks her conservative father, played by actor Brian Knudson, for her hand in marriage, but the father refuses and won't explain why. The mother, played by actress Mary Kay McCartney, is somewhat softer. Eventually, Nasri secretly proposes to her and together with the rest of the band, try to convince the father, but he still refuses. Nasri marries her anyway and all party in the garage as Parker proclaims her love for Nasri and she abandons her overprotective father's house once and for all. The video was released on the band's YouTube account on December 5, 2013. As of September 2020, the video has over 2 billion views on YouTube, and is one of the top 70 most viewed videos on the site.\n\n\"Rude\" entered the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 97 on May 10, 2014. On the issue dated July 26, 2014, the song reached number one, marking their first and only number-one single. \"Rude\" spent six consecutive weeks at number one. On the chart issue dated September 6, 2014, the song tumbled from number one to number 5 on the Hot 100 as Taylor Swift's \"Shake It Off\" debuted atop the chart. This is the first time since The Black Eyed Peas' \"I Gotta Feeling\" that a song fell all the way to the number 5 spot after spending as many as six weeks atop the chart. The song spent 16 weeks in the chart's top 10. Magic! is the sixth Canadian band to top the Billboard Hot 100, the first since Nickelback with \"How You Remind Me\" in 2001. It is also the ninth reggae song to reach the summit, the last being Sean Paul's \"Get Busy\" in 2003.\n\n\"Rude\" reached number two on the Billboard Hot Digital Songs on June 18, 2014, selling 207,000 digital copies. The following week the song peaked at number one, selling 210,000. It is only the second reggae song to top the Billboard Hot Digital Songs, after Sean Kingston's \"Beautiful Girls\" in 2007. The song was certified three-times Platinum by the RIAA in September 2014 and has sold 3 million copies in the US, as of January 2015.\n\n\"Rude\" peaked at number six on the Canadian Hot 100 and remained on the chart for 69 weeks. In Australia, \"Rude\" peaked at number two on the Australian Singles Chart. In New Zealand, the song peaked at number two on the New Zealand Singles Chart. In the United Kingdom, \"Rude\" debuted at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart on July 20, 2014 ― for the week ending date July 26, 2014 ― before climbing to number two a week later. The song topped the chart on August 3, 2014 ― for the week ending date August 9, 2014 ― becoming Magic!'s first chart-topper in Britain.

                "description": "24°C is the first EP by South Korean singer Lee Hi, released on May 30, 2019, through YG Entertainment. It is Lee's first release since her three-year hiatus following the release of her studio album in 2016. The EP features the lead single \"No One\" (누구없소).It is Lee Hi's final release under YG Entertainment.\nAt five tracks, 24°C is the shortest material in Lee Hi's catalogue. The album explores the dark side of romantic relationships, the loneliness and the longing, the frustrating relationships, and the break-ups. Musically, 24°C combines these mostly darker themes with generally upbeat musical genres.\n\nThe opening track of the album, \"No One\" featuring B.I of iKon, as a reggaeton-infused dance track with a \"groovy\" tune full of vibrant percussion, smooth melodies, and quirky synths. It expresses the longing of a lonely person waiting for a lover to arrive with a knock on her door. Lee Hi's collaboration with G.Soul, \"No Way\", is an \"unashamedly laid back track\" with a piano and a low bass. \"Love Is Over\" is \"a gospel, soul-infused ballad\" with a jazzy swing rhythm. It functions very much as a typical break-up tune, reflecting on the struggle to move on the relationship. \"1,2\" featuring Choi Hyunsuk of Treasure, is a \"short but sweet\" track. \"20Min\" is the only self-written song by Lee on the album. The \"guitar-led ballad\" details her anger and annoyance with a certain someone over gentle guitar strums and the sound of water-drops. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/LeeHi/24%E2%84%83\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "name": "Billie Holiday",
        "bio": "Billie Holiday (Eleanora Fagan Gough, Philadelphia, PA, April 7, 1915 – New York City, NY, July 17, 1959) was an American jazz singer and songwriter.\n\nNicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner Lester Young, Holiday was a highly original influence on jazz and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and intimate approach to singing. She co-wrote only a few songs, but several of them have become jazz standards, notably \"God Bless the Child,\" \"Don't Explain,\" and \"Lady Sings the Blues.\" She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by others, including \"Easy Living\" and \"Strange Fruit.\"\nMusic critic Robert Christgau called her \"uncoverable, possibly the greatest singer of the century\".\nCritic John Bush wrote that she \"changed the art of American pop vocals forever.\"\n\nBillie Holiday had a difficult childhood, which greatly affected her life and career. Not much is known about the true details of her early life, though stories of it appeared in her autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, first published in 1956 and later revealed to contain many inaccuracies.\n\nHer professional pseudonym was taken from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Holiday, her probable father. At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \"Halliday\", presumably to distance herself from her neglectful father, but eventually changed it back to \"Holiday\".\n\nThere is some controversy regarding Holiday's paternity, stemming from a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives that lists the father as a \"Frank DeViese\". Some historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker.\n\nThrown out of her parents' home in Baltimore after becoming pregnant at thirteen, Billie's mother, Sadie Fagan, moved to Philadelphia where Billie was born. Mother and child eventually settled in a poor section of Baltimore. Her parents married when she was three, but they soon divorced, leaving her to be raised largely by her mother and other relatives. At the age of 10, she reported that she had been raped. That claim, combined with her frequent truancy, resulted in her being sent to The House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic reform school, in 1925. It was only through the assistance of a family friend that she was released two years later. Scarred by these experiences, Holiday moved to New York City with her mother in 1928. In 1929 Holiday's mother discovered a neighbor, Wilbert Rich, in the act of raping her daughter; Rich was sentenced to three months in jail.\n\nAccording to Billie Holiday's own account, she was recruited by a brothel, worked as a prostitute in 1930, and was eventually imprisoned for a short time for solicitation. It was in Harlem, New York in the early 1930s that she started singing for tips in various night clubs. According to legend, penniless and facing eviction, she sang \"Travelin All Alone\" in a local club and reduced the audience to tears. She later worked at various clubs for tips, ultimately landing at Pod's and Jerry's, a well known Harlem jazz club. Her early work history is hard to verify, though accounts say she was working at a club named Monette's in 1933 when she was discovered by talent scout John Hammond.\n\nHammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut in November 1933 with Benny Goodman singing two songs: \"Your Mother's Son-In-Law\" and \"Riffin' the Scotch.\" Goodman was also on hand in 1935, when she continued her recording career with a group led by pianist Teddy Wilson. Their first collaboration included \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Miss Brown To You,\" which helped to establish Holiday as a major vocalist. She began recording under her own name a year later, producing a series of extraordinary performances with groups comprising the Swing Era's finest musicians.\n\nWilson was signed to Brunswick Records by John Hammond for the purpose of recording current pop tunes in the new Swing style for the growing jukebox trade. They were given free rein to improvise the material. Holiday's amazing method of improvising the melody line to fit the emotion was revolutionary. (Wilson and Holiday took pedestrian pop tunes like \"Twenty-Four Hours A Day\" or \"Yankee Doodle Never Went To Town\" and turned them into jazz classics with their arrangements.) With few exceptions, the recordings she made with Wilson or under her own name during the 1930s and early 1940s are regarded as important parts of the jazz vocal library.\n\nBillie also wrote songs during the 1930s. Such songs include \"Billie's Blues\", \"Tell Me More (And Then Some)\", \"Everything Happens For The Best\", \"Our Love Is Different\", and \"Long Gone Blues\".\n\nAmong the musicians who accompanied her frequently was tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom she had a special rapport. \"Well, I think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know. Some time I'd sit down and listen to 'em myself, and it sound like two of the same voices, if you don't be careful, you know, or the same mind, or something like that.\"[9] Young nicknamed her \"Lady Day\" and she, in turn, dubbed him \"Prez.\" She did a three-month residency at Clark Monroe's Uptown House in New York in 1937. In the late 1930s, she also had brief stints as a big band vocalist with Count Basie (1937) and Artie Shaw (1938). The latter association placed her among the first black women to work with a white orchestra, an arrangement that went against the tenor of the times.\n\nHoliday was recording for Columbia in the late 1930s when she was introduced to \"Strange Fruit\", a song based on a poem about lynching written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx. Meeropol used the pseudonym \"Lewis Allan\" for the poem, which was set to music and performed at teachers' union meetings. It was eventually heard by Barney Josephson, proprietor of Café Society, an integrated nightclub in Greenwich Village, who introduced it to Holiday. She performed it at the club in 1939, with some trepidation, fearing possible retaliation. Holiday later said that the imagery in \"Strange Fruit\" reminded her of her father's death, and that this played a role in her resistance to performing it. In a 1958 interview, she also bemoaned the fact that many people did not grasp the song's message: \"They'll ask me to 'sing that sexy song about the people swinging'\", she said.\n\nWhen Holiday's producers at Columbia found the subject matter too sensitive, Milt Gabler agreed to record it for his Commodore Records. That was done in April, 1939 and \"Strange Fruit\" remained in her repertoire for twenty years. She later recorded it again for Verve. While the Commodore release did not get airplay, the controversial song sold well, though Gabler attributed that mostly to the record's other side, \"Fine and Mellow\", which was a jukebox hit.\n\nIn addition to owning Commodore Records, Milt Gabler was an A&R man for Decca Records, and he signed Holiday to the label in 1944. Her first recording for Decca, \"Lover Man\", was a song written especially for her by Jimmy Davis, Roger \"Ram\" Ramirez, and Jimmy Sherman. Although its lyrics describe a woman who has never known love (\"I long to try something I never had\"), its theme—a woman longing for a missing lover—and its refrain, \"Lover man, oh, where can you be?\", struck a chord in wartime America and the record became one of her biggest hits.\n\nHoliday continued to record for Decca until 1950, including sessions with the Duke Ellington and Count Basie orchestras, and two duets with Louis Armstrong. Holiday's Decca recordings featured big bands and, sometimes, strings, contrasting her intimate small group Columbia accompaniments. Some of the songs from her Decca repertoire became signatures, including \"Don't Explain\" and \"Good Morning Heartache\".\n\nHoliday made one major film appearance, opposite Louis Armstrong in New Orleans (1947). The musical drama featured Holiday singing with Armstrong and his band and was directed by Arthur Lubin. Holiday was not pleased that her role was that of a maid, as she recalled in her autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues: \"I thought I was going to play myself in it. I thought I was going to be Billie Holiday doing a couple of songs in a nightclub setting and that would be that. I should have known better. When I saw the script, I did. You just tell one Negro girl who's made movies who didn't play a maid or a whore. I don't know any. I found out I was going to do a little singing, but I was still playing the part of a maid.\"\n\nOn May 16, 1947, Holiday was arrested for the possession of narcotics and drugs in her New York apartment. On May 27, 1947, she was in court. \"It was called 'The United States of America versus Billie Holiday'. And that's just the way it felt,\" Holiday recalled in her autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues. Holiday pleaded guilty and was sentenced to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia. Holiday said she never \"sang a note\" at Alderson even though people wanted her to. Luckily for Holiday, she was released early (March 16, 1948) due to good behavior. When she arrived at Newark, everybody was there to welcome her back, including her pianist Bobby Tucker. \"I might just as well have wheeled into Penn Station and had a quiet little get-together with the Associated Press, United Press, and International News Service.\"\n\nEd Fishman (who fought with Joe Glaser to be Holiday's manager) thought of the idea to throw a comeback concert at Carnegie Hall. Holiday hesitated at the idea because she thought that nobody would accept her back, but she decided to go with the idea.\n\nOn March 27, 1948, the Carnegie concert was a success. Everything was sold out before the concert started. It isn't certain how many sets Holiday did. She did sing Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\" and \"Strange Fruit\". The concert was not recorded.\n\nAlthough childless, Billie Holiday had two godchildren: singer Billie Lorraine Feather, daughter of Leonard Feather, and Bevan Dufty, son of William Dufty.\n\nHoliday stated that she began using hard drugs in the early 1940s. She married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. While still married to Monroe, she became romantically involved with trumpeter Joe Guy, her drug dealer, eventually becoming his common law wife. She finally divorced Monroe in 1947, and also split with Guy. Because of her 1947 conviction, her New York City Cabaret Card was revoked which kept her from working in clubs there for the remaining 12 years of her life, except when she played at the Ebony Club in 1948, where she opened under the permission of John Levy.\nBy the 1950s, Holiday's drug abuse, drinking, and relations with abusive men led to deteriorating health. As evidenced by her later recordings, Holiday's voice coarsened and did not project the vibrance it once had. However, she retained — and, perhaps, strengthened — the emotional impact of her delivery (See below).\nOn March 28, 1952, Holiday married Louis McKay, a Mafia enforcer. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive, but he did try to get her off drugs. They were separated at the time of her death, but McKay had plans to start a chain of Billie Holiday vocal studios, a la Arthur Murray dance schools.\n\nHer late recordings on Verve constitute about a third of her commercial recorded legacy and are as well remembered as her earlier work for the Columbia, Commodore and Decca labels. In later years her voice became more fragile, but it never lost the edge that had always made it so distinctive. On November 10, 1956, she performed before a packed audience at Carnegie Hall, a major accomplishment for any artist, especially a black artist of the segregated period of American history. Her performance of \"Fine And Mellow\" on CBS's The Sound of Jazz program is memorable for her interplay with her long-time friend Lester Young; both were less than two years from death. (see the clip here)\n\nHoliday first toured Europe in 1954, as part of a Leonard Feather package that also included Buddy DeFranco and Red Norvo. When she returned, almost five years later, she made one of her last television appearances for Granada's \"Chelsea at Nine\", in London. Her final studio recordings were made for MGM in 1959, with lush backing from Ray Ellis and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on Columbia's Lady in Satin album the previous year — see below). The MGM sessions were released posthumously on a self-titled album, later re-titled and re-released as Last Recordings.\n\nHoliday's autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, was ghostwritten by William Dufty and published in 1956. Dufty, a New York Post writer and editor then married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty, wrote the book quickly from a series of conversations with the singer in the Duftys' 93rd Street apartment, drawing on the work of earlier interviewers as well. His aim was to let Holiday tell her story her way.\n\nOn May 31, 1959, she was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York suffering from liver and heart disease. Police officers were stationed at the door to her room. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying and her hospital room was raided by authorities.[12] Holiday remained under police guard at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959. In the final years of her life, she had been progressively swindled out of her earnings, and she died with $0.70 in the bank and $750 (a tabloid fee) on her person.\n\nHer distinct delivery made Billie Holiday's performances instantly recognizable throughout her career. Her voice lacked range and was somewhat thin, plus years of abuse eventually altered the texture of her voice and gave it a prepossessing fragility. Nonetheless, the emotion with which she imbued each song remained not only intact but also profound.[13]. Her last major recording, a 1958 album entitled Lady in Satin, features the backing of a 40-piece orchestra conducted and arranged by Ray Ellis, who said of the album in 1997: \"I would say that the most emotional moment was her listening to the playback of \"I'm a Fool to Want You.\" There were tears in her eyes ... After we finished the album I went into the control room and listened to all the takes. I must admit I was unhappy with her performance, but I was just listening musically instead of emotionally. It wasn't until I heard the final mix a few weeks later that I realized how great her performance really was\".\n\nIn 1972, Diana Ross portrayed her in the film Lady Sings the Blues, which is loosely based on the 1959 autobiography of the same name. The 1972 film earned Ross a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1987, Billie Holiday was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1994, the United States Postal Service introduced a Billie Holiday postage stamp, she ranked #6 on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Rock n' Roll in 1999, and she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. Over the years, there have been many tributes to Billie Holiday, including \"The Day Lady Died\", a 1959 poem by Frank O'Hara, and \"Angel of Harlem\", a 1988 release by the group U2.\n\nSongs composed by Holiday\n\"Billie's Blues\" (1936) \n\"Don't Explain\" (1944) \n\"Everything Happens For The Best\" (1939) \n\"Fine and Mellow\" (1939) \n\"God Bless the Child\" (1941) \n\"Lady Sings the Blues\" (1956) \n\"Long Gone Blues\" (1939) \n\"Now or Never\" (1949) \n\"Our Love Is Different\" (1939) \n\"Stormy Blues\" (1954) \n\nDiscography\nHoliday recorded extensively for four labels: Columbia Records, issued on its subsidiary labels Brunswick Records, Vocalion Records, and OKeh Records, from 1933 through 1942, and the label proper in 1958; Commodore Records in 1939 and 1944; Decca Records from 1944 through 1950; and Verve Records, also on its earlier imprint Clef Records, from 1952 through 1958. Many of Holiday's recordings appeared on 78 rpm records prior to the long-playing vinyl record era, and only Clef, Verve, and Columbia issued Holiday albums in the 1950s during her lifetime that were not compilations of previously released material. Many compilations have been issued since her death; comprehensive box sets and a selection of live recordings are listed below.\n\nGrammy Hall of Fame\nBillie Holiday was posthumously inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old, and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\"\n\nBillie Holiday: Grammy Hall of Fame Awards\nYear Recorded Title Genre Label Year Inducted Notes \n1944 \"Embraceable You\" Jazz (single) Commodore 2005 \n1958 Lady in Satin Jazz (album) Columbia 2000 \n1945 \"Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)\" Jazz (single) Decca 1989 \n1939 \"Strange Fruit\" Jazz (single) Commodore 1978 Listed also in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress in 2002 \n1941 \"God Bless the Child\" Jazz (single) Okeh 1976 \n\n\nGrammy Best Historical Album\nThe Grammy Award for Best Historical Album has been presented since 1979.\n2002 Lady Day: The Complete Billie Holiday Columbia 1933-1944 Winner \n1994 The Complete Billie Holiday Verve 1945-1959 Winner \n1992 Billie Holiday — The Complete Decca Recordings Verve 1944-1950 Winner \n1980 Billie Holiday — Giants of Jazz Time-Life Winner  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lady Day herself said that this session (which finds her accompanied by Ray Ellis' string orchestra) was her personal favorite, and many listeners have found her emotional versions of such songs as \"I'm a Fool to Want You,\" \"You Don't Know What Love Is,\" \"Glad to Be Unhappy,\" and particularly \"You've Changed\" to be quite touching. But Holiday's voice was essentially gone by 1958, and although not yet 43, she could have passed for 73. Ellis' arrangements do not help, veering close to Muzak; most of this record is very difficult to listen to. Late in life, Holiday expressed the pain of life so effectively that her croaking voice had become almost unbearable to hear. There is certainly a wide range of opinion as to the value of this set.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday/Lady+In+Satin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Strange Fruit\" is a song performed most famously by Billie Holiday. It condemned American racism, particularly the lynching of African Americans that had occurred chiefly in the South but also in all regions of the United States. Holiday's version of the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1978. It was also included in the list of Songs of the Century, by the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nAuthor\n\n\"Strange Fruit\" began as a poem written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish high-school teacher from the Bronx, about the lynching of two black men. He published under the pen name Lewis Allan. Meeropol and his wife adopted Robert and Michael, sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted of espionage and executed by the United States.\n\nMeeropol wrote \"Strange Fruit\" to express his horror at lynchings after seeing Lawrence Beitler's photograph of the lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith in Marion, Indiana. He published the poem in 1936 in The New York Teacher, a union magazine. Though Meeropol/Allan had often asked others (notably Earl Robinson) to set his poems to music, he set Strange Fruit to music himself. The song gained a certain success as a protest song in and around New York. Meeropol, his wife, and black vocalist Laura Duncan performed it at Madison Square Garden.\n\nBarney Josephson, the founder of Cafe Society in Greenwich Village, New York's first integrated nightclub, heard the song and introduced it to Billie Holiday. Holiday performed the song at Cafe Society in 1939. She said that singing it made her fearful of retaliation. Holiday later said that because the imagery in \"Strange Fruit\" reminded her of her father, she persisted in singing it. The song became a regular part of Holiday's live performances.\n\nHoliday approached her recording label, Columbia, about recording the song. Columbia, fearing a backlash by record retailers in the South, as well as negative reaction from affiliates of Columbia's co-owned radio network, CBS, refused to record the song.  Even her great producer at Columbia, John Hammond, refused. In frustration she turned to her friend Milt Gabler (uncle of comedian Billy Crystal) whose Commodore label produced alternative jazz. Holiday sang the song for him a cappella which so moved Gabler that he wept. In 1939 Gabler worked out a special arrangement with Vocalian Records to record and distribute the song and Columbia allowed Holiday a one-session release from her contract in order to record it.\n\nShe recorded two major sessions at Commodore, one in 1939 and one in 1944. \"Strange Fruit\" was highly regarded. In time it became Holiday's biggest selling record. Though the song became a staple of her live performances, Holiday's accompanist Bobby Tucker recalled that Holiday would break down every time after she sang it.\n\nIn her autobiography Lady Sings the Blues, Holiday suggested that she, together with Lewis Allan, her accompanist Sonny White, and arranger Danny Mendelsohn, put the poem to music. David Margolick and Hilton Als dismissed that claim in their work Strange Fruit: The Biography of a Song. They wrote that hers was \"an account that may set a record for most misinformation per column inch\". When challenged, Holiday—whose autobiography had been ghostwritten by William Dufty—claimed, \"I ain't never read that book.\"\n\nMeaning\n\nThe \"strange fruit\" referred to in the song are the bodies of African American men being hanged during a lynching. They contrast the pastoral scenes of the South with the ugliness of racist violence. The lyrics were so chilling that Holiday later said \"The first time I sang it, I thought it was a mistake. There wasn't even a patter of applause when I finished. Then a lone person began to clap nervously. Then suddenly everyone was clapping and cheering.\"\n\nImpact\n\nBarney Josephson recognized the impact of the song and insisted that Holiday close all her shows with it. Just as the song was about to begin, waiters would stop serving, the lights in club would be turned off, and a single pin spotlight would illuminate Holiday on stage. During the musical introduction, Holiday would stand with her eyes closed, as if she were evoking a prayer.\n\nThe song ultimately became the anthem of the anti-lynching movement. The dark imagery of the lyrics struck a chord. It also contributed to what would later become the Civil Rights movement of the 50s and 60s.\n\nThe song became an instant success and was most identified with Holiday. Numerous other singers have performed it. In October 1939, Samuel Grafton of The New York Post described \"Strange Fruit\": \"If the anger of the exploited ever mounts high enough in the South, it now has its Marseillaise.\"\n\nIn December, 1999, Time (magazine) magazine called it the song of the century.\n\nIn 2002, the Library of Congress honored the song as one of 50 recordings chosen that year to be added to the National Recording Registry.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution listed the song as Number One on 100 Songs of the South.   Bob Dylan cited \"Strange Fruit\" as an influence in the 2005 documentary No Direction Home. The movie also had a brief clip of Holiday singing.\n\nSerbian rock musician, journalist and writer Dejan Cukić wrote about \"Strange Fruit\" among forty-five other songs that changed the history of popular music in his book 45 obrtaja: Priče o pesmama.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday/_/Strange+Fruit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"God Bless the Child\" is a song written by Billie Holiday and Arthur Herzog Jr. in 1939, first recorded on May 9, 1941 under the Okeh label. Holiday's version of the song was honored with the Grammy Hall of Fame Award in (1976). It was also included in the list of Songs of the Century, by the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment for the Arts. In her autobiography Lady Sings the Blues Holiday indicated an argument with her mother over money led to the song. She indicated that during the argument she said the line \"God bless the child that's got his own.\" The anger over the incident led her to turn that line into a starting point for a song, which she worked out in conjunction with Herzog. In Jazz Singing Will Friedwald indicates it as \"sacred and profane\" as it references the Bible while indicating that religion seems to have no effect in making people treat each other better. The lyrics refer to an unspecified Biblical verse: \"Them that's got shall get, them that don't shall lose, so the Bible says, and it still is news. . . . \" This likely refers to Matthew 25:29. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Holiday/_/God+Bless+The+Child\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "\nAlfred Éric Leslie Satie (Honfleur, 17 May 1866–Paris, 1 July 1925) was a French composer, pianist, and writer.\n\nOver the years, Erik Satie was described as a precursor of movements and styles as varied as Impressionism, Neo-Classicism, Dada, Surrealism, Conceptual art, minimalism, and ambient music. As well as taking the first steps towards techniques such as prepared piano and music-to-film synchronisation, Satie became one of the first musicians to perform a cameo appearance in a film, in 1924's Entr'acte by the French filmmaker René Clair.\n\nSatie appears to have been the avant-garde to half of the avant-garde movements of the twentieth century. He was in contact with Tristan Tzara, the initiator of the Dada movement. He got to know the other Dadaists, such as Francis Picabia (later to become a Surrealist), André Derain, Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray.  Satie contributed to the Dadaist publication 391. In the first months of 1922, he was surprised to find himself entangled in the argument between Tzara and André Breton. Satie originally sided with Tzara, but managed to maintain friendly relations with most players in both camps.\n\nSatie is today regarded as a key modernist composer. As well as influencing contemporaries such as Claude Debussy, who orchestrated two of Satie's Gymnopédies, Maurice Ravel, and a group of composers known as the Les Six, his tendency towards simplicity and repetition continue to inform modern avant-garde genres. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Erik+Satie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Anzellotti is an Italian-born accordionist who has worked in a large variety of new music contexts. Anzellotti's approach to Erik Satie with regard to tempos and accent is almost identical to Aldo Ciccolini. This album contains a non-obligatory choice of material. Although the disc ends with the first \"Gymnopedie\" and includes all six \"Gnossienne\"s, much of the remainder of the program is concentrated on lesser-known but equally beautiful compositions.

                "description": "This album is part of a series called \"Composure: Classical Reworks for Modern Relief\". Aimed at providing mental and spiritual respite in our uncertain era, the series was commenced by Joseph Shabason’s take on Erik Satie’s “Gymnopedie No. 1.” In this album Shabason collaborates with Drew Jurecka (strings), while taking on sax and piano himself. The rework gets its unique sound from tape-manipulation and synth. \n\n\"When Satie premiered this piece for the first time, he gathered all of Paris' music critics and musicians into a theater, and had a big cocktail party with a piano player playing background music.” Shabason explains, “Off to the side there was a concert space with a stage, piano, and chairs. After the party everyone filed into the concert space and found their seats. Satie got on stage and told everyone that the background music they just heard over drinks was his new material, ‘thank you and have a good night.’\" Motivated by this story of an innovator breaking format, Shabason's version of the piece intends to capture the opium infused feeling of Paris in the late 1800s, at a cocktail party where voices and conversations drift in and out, ignoring the music that would later prove immortal, let alone spur an entirely new way of listening and composing music in the century to come. Shabason elaborates, invoking the ego dilemma of all working musicians, \"I wanted to capture the loneliness of playing something that's musically meaningful while people just talk over what you're doing and what you've created. It's something that every gigging musician has experienced, and it's fucking awful...but there is also a kind of warm loneliness to it. You know that no one cares about your music, and in that knowledge you are left with the feeling of doing something just for yourself…which further solidifies your resolve and investment in what you’re doing.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Erik+Satie/Gymnop%C3%A9die+No.+1\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "These Three Gnossiennes were composed around 1890 and first published in 1893. A revision prior to publication in 1893 is not unlikely; the 2nd Gnossienne may even have been composed in that year (it has \"April 1893\" as date on the manuscript). The piano solo versions of the first three Gnossiennes are without time signatures or bar lines, which is known as free time.\nThese Gnossiennes were first published in Le Figaro musical No. 24 of September 1893 (Gnossiennes Nos. 1 and 3, the last one of these then still \"No. 2\") and in Le Cœur No. 6–7 of September–October 1893 (Gnossienne No. 2 printed as facsimile, then numbered \"No. 6\").\nThe first grouped publication, numbered as known henceforth, followed in 1913. By this time Satie had indicated 1890 as composition date for all three. The first Gnossienne was dedicated to Alexis Roland-Manuel in the 1913 reprint. The 1893 facsimile print of the 2nd Gnossienne contained a dedication to Antoine de La Rochefoucauld, not repeated in the 1913 print. This de La Rochefoucauld had been a co-founder of Joséphin Péladan's Ordre de la Rose-Croix Catholique et Esthetique du Temple et du Graal in 1891. By the second publication of the first set of three Gnossiennes, Satie had broken already for a long time with all Rosicrucian type of endeavours.\nAlso with respect to the tempo these Gnossiennes follow the Gymnopédies line: slow tempos, respectively Lent (French for Lento/slow), avec étonnement (\"with astonishment\"), and again Lent.\nA sketch containing only two incomplete bars, dated around 1890, shows Satie beginning to orchestrate the 3rd Gnossienne.\nThe first and third Gnossiennes share a similar chordal structures, rhythm and share reference to each other's thematic material. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Erik+Satie/_/3+Gnossiennes:+Gnossienne+No.3\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Daniel Hernandez (born May 8, 1996) professionally known as 6ix9ine or Tekashi69, is a Mexican-American rapper who is based in Brooklyn. Hernandez is known for his distinctive rainbow-themed look, tattoos, aggressive style of rapping, public feuds with fellow celebrities, legal issues, and controversial public persona.\n\nHernandez rose to mainstream fame in late 2017 with the release of his debut single \"Gummo\", which was certified platinum by the RIAA. In early 2018, Hernandez released his debut mixtape, Day69, which debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart. He later earned his first top-five entry on the Billboard Hot 100 with \"Fefe\", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz, which peaked at number three on the chart. His debut studio album, Dummy Boy, was released on November 27, 2018, after being delayed a week earlier due to his arrest, and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. \n\nHernandez pled guilty to using a 13-year-old child in a sexual performance in 2015. He was arrested in November 2018 on racketeering and firearm charges, among others, for which he is facing a possible life sentence in federal prison.\n\nEarly Life\nHe was raised with his older brother by his parents until he was 13, when his father was shot dead steps away from the family home. Emotionally disturbed by the death of his father, Hernandez started to act out and was eventually expelled from school in the 8th grade for bad behavior. Rather than continue his education, he started working various odd jobs such as working as a busboy to help his mother financially. Hernandez also dealt drugs to supplement his income, most notably selling cannabis and heroin on the streets while working at a local Brooklyn bodega. He was eventually arrested for his criminal activities and sentenced to prison time at Rikers Island, where he began to associate himself with the Nine Trey Gangsters, a prison subset of the Bloods street gang. Hernandez began his career as a rapper in 2014, releasing songs such as \"69\" and \"Scumlife\". Other early songs were taken down by YouTube.\n\nCareer\nHernandez began releasing rap songs in 2014. Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as \"Scumlife\", \"Yokai\", and \"Hellsing Station\", drawing attention for his aggressive rapping style and use of anime as music video visuals. Many of his early songs were released by FCK THEM, a music label based in Slovakia. Gathering fame as an internet meme for his rainbow-dyed hair and rainbow-plated grills, he eventually became an associate of fellow New York rapper ZillaKami. They later feuded after Hernandez allegedly stole instrumentals and songs they had made together.\n\nHernandez's commercial debut single \"Gummo\" was released on November 10, 2017, and eventually peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was certified platinum by the RIAA on March 5, 2018. His next single, \"Kooda\", debuted at number 61 on the Hot 100 the week of December 23, 2017. On January 14, 2018, Hernandez released his third single, \"Keke\", with Fetty Wap and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, which also charted on the Hot 100.\n\nShortly afterward, Hernandez announced his debut mixtape, titled Day69. The mixtape was released on February 23, 2018, and debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 album chart with 55,000 album-equivalent units, of which 20,000 were pure sales. According to Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, the tape was an outgrowth of the \"SoundCloud rap explosion\", and was notable for its willingness to deviate from hip-hop's prevailing sound. After the release of Day69, two songs from the album, \"Billy\" and \"Rondo\" both debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Billy\" peaking at number 50 and \"Rondo\" at number 73.\n\nIn April 2018, Hernandez released \"Gotti\", a remix of a feature he did for artist Packman titled \"Got it, Got it\". The song's video was released on April 16, 2018, and involved footage of Hernandez donating bundles of $100 bills to poor citizens in the Dominican Republic. The song was added to Day69 as a deluxe song and debuted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 before dropping off the following week, making it his sixth consecutive Hot 100 entry.\n\nHernandez stirred up controversy in May 2018 when he was involved in a shooting with the entourage of fellow New York rapper Casanova as part of a feud; this led to Hernandez losing a $5 million headphone deal and being banned from the Barclays Center. After the shooting, Hernandez stopped releasing music for several months, before releasing \"Tati\", featuring DJ Spinking in June, which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn July 2018, Hernandez released his eighth single, \"Fefe\", featuring Nicki Minaj and Murda Beatz; the single debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 before peaking at number three in its second week, marking 6ix9ine's highest entry on the chart and his first single to reach the top five of the Hot 100. \"Fefe\" was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. His subsequent singles, \"Bebe\" and \"Stoopid\", also reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.\n\nIn early October 2018, Hernandez was featured on the song \"Aulos Reloaded\" with French house DJ Vladimir Cauchemar and \"Kick\" with Danish singer Jimilian.\n\nOn November 7, 2018, it was announced that his debut studio album, Dummy Boy, was to be released on November 23, but on November 21, it was announced that the album would be postponed. The album was ultimately released without notice on November 27, on all streaming services. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/6ix9ine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On November 18, 2018, he took to Instagram once more to tease the album’s tracklist, revealing it to have a total of thirteen songs and guest appearances from ten different artists. The project, however, did not drop on the announced release date of November 23, 2018, due to his unforeseen arrest for racketeering and firearms offenses. A day after the album’s promised release date, the project leaked online in its entirety due to it being momentarily available for purchase on his official online store.\n\nPrior to the album’s release, the aforementioned “TATI,” “FEFE,” “BEBE,” and “STOOPID” were released as promotional singles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/6ix9ine/DUMMY+BOY\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "TROLLZ is a song by American rapper 6ix9ine and Trinidadian rapper Nicki Minaj. After being postponed twice, it was released June 12, 2020 as the second single off 6ix9ine's sophomore studio album TattleTales (2020), as the follow-up to \"GOOBA\", released four weeks earlier. It was written by the two rappers, along with its producers Sadpony and Jahnei Clarke, the latter having also produced \"GOOBA\". The song marked the third collaboration between the Hernandez and Minaj, following \"FEFE\" and \"MAMA\", both released in 2018. Lyrically, the song takes aim at internet trolls. On June 16, 2020, a new version of the song was released, featuring a different verse from Minaj and an altered beat. It became the first song from an indie label to top the charts in the US since XXXTENTACION's SAD! in 2018. \"TROLLZ\" set the record for being the first song by a lead female rapper to debut at number one.\n\nThe song is driven by an electronic drum backing track and contains a laconic beat. On the song, 6ix9ine employs his \"usual\" braggadocious delivery, with Minaj's lyrics containing sex euphemisms. Minaj explained that she recorded eleven different versions before the song was released in its final form.\n\nAlex Zidel of HotNewHipHop noted that Minaj's verse contains a possible dig at singer Usher, when she raps: \"Somebody usher this nigga into a clinic/My flow's still sick, I ain't talkin' a pandemic\". Shortly before the song's release, Usher had said Minaj \"got her 'blueprint' from Lil Kim\", and he previously faced herpes accusations.\n\nAn alternate version of the song was also released, which opens with Minaj's original verse, as she raps in English with Spanish words (\"He tryna put it in my culo, real fat gato / When he eat it, I tell him to squeeze it like a taco\"). Prior to the song's release, Minaj tweeted the taco emoji, hinting at the song's lyrics. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/6ix9ine/TROLLZ+(with+Nicki+Minaj)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, Trippie sent this to 6ix9ine and he recorded Gummo. Pierre was not aware of the transaction, and he disliked 6ix9ine for his record from 2014 of being present in a situation where there was alleged sexual misconduct with a minor, which is not sexual assault or sexual relations.\n\nThis incident was only brought to the attention of authority because the girl went missing. Even though this incident was in 2014 and that 69 was not guilt of any wrong-doing, due to Tekashi69’s boom in popularity from “Gummo”, the Hip Hop community media have only recently, in 2017, become familiar with 69, and have largely misinterpreted this to be a more recent thing. This includes Pi'erre himself, who claims he will never work with Trippie Redd or 6ix9ine again.\n\nIn terms of popularity, Gummo has reached over 30 million views on Youtube, and has reached the 1st place on Soundcloud’s streaming charts, for all of December 2017. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/6ix9ine/GUMMO\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Pi'erre had no idea that his beat was being used by Tekashi, and only found out once the song’s music video was already released on YouTube.\n\nPi'erre publicly objected to being associated with the song, citing 6ix9ine’s previously mentioned child sex charges, and has since asserted that he will never work with Trippie Redd or 6ix9ine ever again.\n\nFor a long time, “GUMMO” was Tekashi’s most viewed and streamed song. It reached over 300 million views on YouTube, and garnered over 100 million streams on SoundCloud, which lead to the track reaching the top spot on its streaming charts for all of December 2017 and January 2018. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/6ix9ine/_/GUMMO\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "TROLLZ is a song by American rapper 6ix9ine and Trinidadian rapper Nicki Minaj. After being postponed twice, it was released June 12, 2020 as the second single off 6ix9ine's sophomore studio album TattleTales (2020), as the follow-up to \"GOOBA\", released four weeks earlier. It was written by the two rappers, along with its producers Sadpony and Jahnei Clarke, the latter having also produced \"GOOBA\". The song marked the third collaboration between the Hernandez and Minaj, following \"FEFE\" and \"MAMA\", both released in 2018. Lyrically, the song takes aim at internet trolls. On June 16, 2020, a new version of the song was released, featuring a different verse from Minaj and an altered beat. It became the first song from an indie label to top the charts in the US since XXXTENTACION's SAD! in 2018. \"TROLLZ\" set the record for being the first song by a lead female rapper to debut at number one.\n\nThe song is driven by an electronic drum backing track and contains a laconic beat. On the song, 6ix9ine employs his \"usual\" braggadocious delivery, with Minaj's lyrics containing sex euphemisms. Minaj explained that she recorded eleven different versions before the song was released in its final form.\n\nAlex Zidel of HotNewHipHop noted that Minaj's verse contains a possible dig at singer Usher, when she raps: \"Somebody usher this nigga into a clinic/My flow's still sick, I ain't talkin' a pandemic\". Shortly before the song's release, Usher had said Minaj \"got her 'blueprint' from Lil Kim\", and he previously faced herpes accusations.\n\nAn alternate version of the song was also released, which opens with Minaj's original verse, as she raps in English with Spanish words (\"He tryna put it in my culo, real fat gato / When he eat it, I tell him to squeeze it like a taco\"). Prior to the song's release, Minaj tweeted the taco emoji, hinting at the song's lyrics. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/6ix9ine/_/TROLLZ+(with+nicki+minaj)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on July 3, 2020, alongside a music video, as the third single from his second studio album, TattleTales, released on September 4, 2020. The song was written by 6ix9ine, Anuel AA, Anas Rahmoune, Edgar Semper, John Iyinbor, Kedin Maysonet, Luian Malave, Pablo Fuentes, and Xavier Semper and produced by Ramoon and Ransom Beatz. It interpolates the 2003 song \"Baila Morena\" by Puerto Rican reggaeton duo Héctor & Tito.\n\n6ix9ine first announced the song and its release date on June 27, 2020, in an Instagram Story. He confirmed the track's title in an Instagram video on June 29, with a bikini-clad woman giving him a lap dance and twerking in a studio. He previewed the song with him singing in Spanish and further called it his \"best one so far\". This marks the third time 6ix9ine, whose mother is Mexican and father is Puerto Rican, released a Spanish song, following the Dummy Boy tracks \"Bebe\" and \"Mala\", both of which featured Puerto Rican singer Anuel AA.\n\nOn September 4, 2020, 6ix9ine announced in a Billboard interview that Anuel AA was supposed to be in \"Yaya\" and they wrote the song together. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/6ix9ine/_/YAYA\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I feel disrespected. I'm hands on with ALL of my creative & had such a dope rollout for 'best friends'. The thirst for clout & $ is real & it overrides the artists' art.\" The single was later taken off streaming services the following day.\n\n\"Best Friend\" was then officially released on January 7, 2021 for digital download and streaming. The track was sent to both contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States on January 12, 2021.\n\nThe song's first official remix features vocals from British rapper Stefflon Don.\nWhile the second features Chinese rapper VaVa.\nA third, with New Zealand rapper JessB and Australian singer Okenyo.\nA fourth, with South Korean singer Jamie and South Korean/Japanese rapper Chanmina,\nand fifth, with German rapper Katja Krasavice, were also released.

The song samples rapper Too Short's signature 2006 single \"Blow the Whistle\", produced by Lil Jon. Too Short provides the intro on \"Tap In\". Produced and co-written by Dr. Luke, it marked Saweetie's second song to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nTap In\" marks Saweetie's first release without a feature since 2019's \"My Type\"; she explained she had to focus on her artist development because it was something she struggled with. Saweetie stated that Too Short is one of her favorite rappers, and she was concerned that he would not like the song, however she got his blessing for the sample. With both artists being from California's Bay Area, Saweetie explained: \"If you listen to Bay Area hip-hop, it's very fly. It's not necessarily punchlines, but like a fly way of describing what's happening to us or how we're feeling. It's super conversational and very relatable\". The song was first previewed on Saweetie's Instagram, and debuted two days later on Apple Music's Beats 1 Radio with Zane Lowe.\n\nSaweetie has become known for sampling classic hip hop tracks; she also sampled Khia's \"My Neck, My Back\" on her debut single \"Icy Girl\". She explained her frequent use of samples: \"My specialty is able to have an ear for a beat that would sound good if I flipped it or if I sampled it. Hip-hop is built on samples\".\n\n\"Tap In\" continued the resurgence of producer Dr. Luke, whose career came to standstill after singer Kesha accused him of sexual assault. Earlier in 2020, he produced Doja Cat's US number-one single \"Say So\". He also worked with Kim Petras and produced Juice Wrld's top ten single \"Wishing Well\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Saweetie/_/Tap+In\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "name": "Dean Martin",
        "bio": "Dean Martin (born Dino Paul Crocetti; June 7, 1917 – December 25, 1995) was an American singer, actor, comedian, and producer. One of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th century, Martin was nicknamed the \"King of Cool\" for his seemingly effortless charisma and self-assurance. \n\nHe and Jerry Lewis formed the immensely popular comedy duo Martin and Lewis, with Martin serving as the straight man to Lewis' slapstick hijinks. Martin went on to become a star of concert stages, nightclubs, audio recordings, motion pictures, and television, and was also a member of the \"Rat Pack\". Martin was the host of the television variety programs The Dean Martin Show and The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. His relaxed, warbling, crooning voice earned him dozens of hit singles, including his signature songs \"Memories Are Made of This\", \"That's Amore\", \"Everybody Loves Somebody\", \"You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\", \"Sway\", \"Volare\", and \"Ain't That a Kick in the Head?\" \n\nMartin was born on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio, to an Italian father, Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894–1967), and an Italian-American mother, Angela Crocetti (née Barra; 1899–1966). They were married in 1914. His father, who was a barber, was originally from Montesilvano, in Abruzzo, and his maternal grandparents' origins are believed to be also from Abruzzo, although they are not clearly known. Martin had an older brother named William Alfonso Crocetti (1916–1968). Martin's first language was Abruzzese, a dialect of Neapolitan, and he did not speak English until he started school at the age of five. He attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, where he was bullied for his broken English. He later took up the drums as a hobby as a teenager. Martin then dropped out of Steubenville High School in the 10th grade because he thought he was smarter than his teachers. He bootlegged liquor, served as a speakeasy croupier, was a blackjack dealer, worked in a steel mill, and boxed as a welterweight. \n\nAs Martin's solo career grew, he and Frank Sinatra became friends. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, and Sammy Davis, Jr. formed the Rat Pack, so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the Holmby Hills Rat Pack centered on Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, of which Sinatra had been a member (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as \"The Summit\" or \"The Clan\" and never as \"The Rat Pack\", although this has remained their identity in popular imagination). The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford's marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President John F. Kennedy).\n\nThe Rat Pack was legendary for its Las Vegas Strip performances. For example, the marquee at the Sands Hotel might read DEAN MARTIN—MAYBE FRANK—MAYBE SAMMY. Their appearances were valuable because the city would flood with wealthy gamblers. Their act (always in tuxedo) consisted of each singing individual numbers, duets and trios, along with seemingly improvised slapstick and chatter. In the socially charged 1960s, their jokes revolved around adult themes, such as Sinatra's womanizing and Martin's drinking, as well as Davis's race and religion. Sinatra and Martin supported the civil rights movement and refused to perform in clubs that would not allow African-American or Jewish performers. Posthumously, the Rat Pack has experienced a popular revival, inspiring the George Clooney/Brad Pitt \"Ocean's Trilogy.\" \n\nMartin returned to films briefly with appearances in the star-laden, critically panned but commercially successful The Cannonball Run and its sequel Cannonball Run II. He also had a minor hit single with \"Since I Met You Baby\" and made his first music video, which appeared on MTV. The video was created by Martin's youngest son, Ricci. On March 21, 1987, Martin's son, actor Dean Paul Martin (formerly Dino of the 1960s \"teeny-bopper\" rock group Dino, Desi & Billy), died when his F-4 Phantom II jet fighter crashed while flying with the California Air National Guard. Martin's grief over his son's death left him depressed and demoralized. Later, a tour with Davis and Sinatra in 1988, undertaken in part to help Martin recover, sputtered.\n\nMartin, who responded best to a club audience, felt lost in the huge stadiums they were performing in at Sinatra's insistence, and he was not interested in drinking until dawn after performances. His final Vegas shows were at Bally's Hotel in 1990. There he had his final reunion with Lewis on his 72nd birthday. Martin's last two TV appearances involved tributes to his former Rat Pack members. On December 8, 1989, he joined stars in Sammy Davis Jr's 60th anniversary celebration, which aired a few weeks before Davis died from throat cancer. In December 1990, he congratulated Sinatra on his 75th birthday special. \n\nMartin, a heavy smoker, was diagnosed with lung cancer at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in September 1993, and was told that he would require surgery to prolong his life, but he rejected it. He retired from public life in early 1995 and died of acute respiratory failure resulting from emphysema at his Beverly Hills home on Christmas Day, 1995 at the age of 78. The lights of the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor. Martin's body was interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. The crypt features the epitaph \"Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime\", the title of his signature song. \n\nIn 1996, Ohio Route 7 through Steubenville was rededicated as Dean Martin Boulevard. Road signs bearing an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Martin's likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street. An annual Dean Martin Festival celebration is held in Steubenville. Impersonators, friends and family, and entertainers, many of Italian ancestry, appear. In 2005, Clark County, Nevada, renamed a portion of Industrial Road as Dean Martin Drive. A similarly named street was dedicated in 2008 in Rancho Mirage, California. Martin's family was presented a gold record in 2004 for Dino: The Essential Dean Martin, his fastest-selling album, which also hit the iTunes Top 10, and in 2006 it was certified \"Platinum\".\n\nFor the week ending December 23, 2006, the Dean Martin and Martina McBride duet of \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" reached No. 7 on the R&R AC chart. It also went to No. 36 on the R&R Country chart – the last time Martin had a song this high in the charts was in 1965, with the song \"I Will,\" which reached No. 10 on the Pop chart. An album of duets, Forever Cool, was released by Capitol/EMI in 2007. It features Martin's voice with Kevin Spacey, Shelby Lynne, Joss Stone, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Robbie Williams, McBride and others. His footprints were immortalized at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1964. Martin has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one at 6519 Hollywood Boulevard for movies; the second at 1617 Vine for recordings; and a third at 6651 Hollywood Boulevard for television. In February 2009, Martin was honored with a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Four of his surviving children, Gail, Deana, Ricci and Gina accepted it on his behalf. In 2010, Martin received a posthumous star on the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nMartin was married three times. His first wife was Elizabeth Anne \"Betty\" McDonald, (July 14, 1922 – July 11, 1989) of Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. Martin and McDonald married in 1941 and had four children: Craig Martin (born 1942), Claudia Martin (March 16, 1944 – February 16, 2001), Gail Martin (born 1945); and Deana Martin (born 1948). Martin and McDonald divorced in 1949 and Dean gained custody of their children. Betty lived out her life in relative obscurity in San Francisco, California.\n\nMartin's second wife was Dorothy Jean \"Jeanne\" Biegger (March 27, 1927 – August 24, 2016), a former Orange Bowl queen from Coral Gables, Florida. Their marriage lasted 24 years (1949–1973) and produced three children: Dean Paul Martin (November 17, 1951 – March 21, 1987), Ricci Martin (September 20, 1953 – August 3, 2016)[15] and Gina Martin (born 1956).\n\nMartin's third marriage, to Catherine Hawn, lasted three years before Martin initiated divorce proceedings. They had no biological children of their own but Martin adopted Hawn's daughter, Sasha.\n\nMartin's uncle was Leonard Barr, who appeared in several of his shows. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he lived at 363 Copa De Oro Road in Bel Air, Los Angeles, before selling it to Tom Jones for $500,000 in June 1976.\n\nMartin's son-in-law was the Beach Boys' Carl Wilson, who married Martin's daughter Gina. Figure skater Dorothy Hamill and actress Olivia Hussey were his daughters-in-law during their marriages to Martin's son, Dean Paul Martin.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dean+Martin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "BETWEEN FRIENDS is an American musical duo, composed of siblings Brandon Hudson and Savannah Hudson. \n\nThe duo were born in Miami, Florida, and grew up in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. They displayed an early interest and aptitude for music, and were home-schooled. In 2013, they auditioned for Season 8 of America's Got Talent, and progressed until being eliminated in the quarterfinals. Two years later they, along with several others, formed a group called The Heirs. They played in the 2016 Vans Warped Tour, but the group disbanded in 2017.\n\nThe duo, along with the drummer of The Heirs, Brennan Benko, split off to create Between Friends in 2017, debuting with the single ‘suburban wonderland’. They established their own sound with these releases, making songs of bedroom pop, laptop pop, and shoegaze dream pop. They are especially known for their 2018 hit EP ‘we just need some time together’, which has more than 170 million streams on Spotify as of September, 2023. In 2019, Brennan Benko quietly left the group to focus on his drumming career, however remained as a collaborator and still works with the group to produce live drums on their songs up to this day.\n\nIn 2021, they released their first mixtape ‘i like when you shine!’ after a nearly 3 year hiatus. This was followed up with the 2022 EP ‘CUTiE’.\n\nIn April 2023, Between Friends announced the release of their first full-length studio album, titled ‘i love my girl, she’s my boy’. They dropped 5 pre-release singles until the subsequent album release on August 25th, 2023. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Between+Friends\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The other 10 songs were revealed when the album was released.\n\nDuring an interview with DIYmag.com, BETWEEN FRIENDS defined what making the album was like and what it means to them.\n\n“This is a piece of us, something we have held very close to our hearts this year. A diary of some sorts and a sonic experiment. For ages we have placed the mixtape format on a pedestal, from the history of frankie knuckles and dj drama all the way down to the old cassettes we’d find in our garage that belonged to our parents in the ‘90s. Making this was a fever dream and the most fun we’ve had in our studio to date. We hope that this finds its way well into your cars and your headphones. Made with luv at home by us for you.“ <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Between+Friends/i+like+when+you+shine!\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "“iloveyou” is the comeback single of BETWEEN FRIENDS, formerly known as “The Heirs” or “HEIRS”.\n\nTheir previous single, “Suburban Wonderland”, came out over a year prior to this release, and concerns similar subject matter. “iloveyou” picks up where it left off, and deals with looking back fondly on the old days where they felt innocent and adventurous.\n\nIn an interview with Galore Magazine, the group answered the question with:\n\n“We finished it, looked at each other and realized that we had made the first song of this new chapter. It was so easy after that to experiment with different musical aesthetics, suddenly, things we had never known felt right for us. There was an instant comfortability with the world we started creating and infinite possibilities to work with, that’s really the beauty of a blank slate”.\n\nFor Flaunt Magazine, the band also revealed how everything came to life:\n\n“It happened pretty randomly around summertime. We were reflecting on situations that had occurred between us and different groups of friends over the past couple of months. We were also thinking about change, artistic growth and progression as a project. We sat down with some gear and some wine, made a pretty rough demo, wrote for hours over it, brought it to a session in Silverlake the following week, and finished it. We’ll never forget the first time we really listened to it though – we were overlooking LA from a lookout near Mulholland, it was around midnight and we kind of slipped it in through our friend’s car speakers. We listened to it in full volume and our friends danced on the hill. That was really cool”.\n\n“We really wanted to capture the essence of our relationship as a group, showing the adventures we went on this past year and the natural love we all share for each other. We used an old VHS camera we found in our garage that belonged to our parent’s in the 90’s. Creating most of it at our house and in our favorite spots in our neighborhood, we wanted to avoid high budget professional shit and show everyone that we are just kids making art together. Giving people a real life experience more than anything was the idea. Just us. Hopefully, it will give you the urge to find an old camera and film your friends. We just want to be as real as possible and create art. Evolving constantly and indefinitely”.\n\n– Galore Magazine <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Between+Friends/_/iloveyou\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The relatable lyrics about the struggles of dating and the \"situationship\" status will resonate with Gen Z listeners.\n\n\n\"We wrote ‘Bruise’ about giving too much to someone who isn’t reciprocating. There’s a desperation you start to feel when you’re trying and longing for someone to want you the same as you do them. After some time you begin acquiring internal scars and bruises. We were both experiencing this feeling at the same time and you can almost hear that in our performances. We brought this song on tour with us and lived with it for months making sure it was what it needed to be. We tried adding and then we tried simplifying, slowing it down, and speeding it up and nothing felt better than how it was from the beginning. With our music, we are constantly chasing a feeling and that was something we re-learned in the process of making this new project. Sometimes it is what it is and that’s what makes it what it’s supposed to be.\"\n\n— via Ones to Watch <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Between+Friends/_/Bruise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Mick Kenney (born 18 January 1980) is a British musician and record producer. Initially most known as the founding member of the extreme metal act Anaal Nathrakh, he began producing phonk music in 2020.“Phonk sounded similar to what I was already doing,” he says. “It was super dark, with almost a horror vibe, but in a hip-hop way.” Kordhell genre and composition style is a somewhat mix of phonk, Memphis rap, hip-hop & rock. He got signed to Black 17 Media in October 2020 when he had 5000 streams, which has since risen to 480 million on his top hit \"Murder In My Mind\". The song has charted in Austria, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nKordhell will be the first phonk artist to embark on an official, national U.S. tour, according to a press release shared with EDM.com. The pioneering producer has flown the flag of phonk since as early as January 2022, when he released his breakout hit, \"Murder In My Mind.\" With its distorted sound design, edgy aesthetic and vintage hip-hop influences, the song effectively lit the fuse of a full-blown movement on TikTok, wherein it has soundtracked over a million videos. Due in part to its volcanic success on social media, Kordhell went on to amass a staggering 14 million monthly listeners on Spotify, making him one of the platform's top 500 artists in the world.\n\nKordhell's \"Murder in the USA\" tour will hit a bevy of major cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. \n\nIn his early music career, Kenney gained popularity as the founding member of the extreme metal act Anaal Nathrakh, for which he performs under the stage name Irrumator. He started out as lead guitarist but is now playing guitar, bass, and programs drums. They have released a total of eleven albums since being formed in 1998.\n\nHe relocated to Orange County, California, in 2007. There, he founded the clothing label Misanthropy Clothing in 2013.\n\nIn 2020 he formed the black metal band Make Them Die Slowly together with fellow musician Duncan Wilkins. They both operate under stage names. Mick Kenney as Officer R. Kordhell and Duncan Wilkins as The Void. The band was formed as a celebration of vintage gore films. Other bands Kenney has been in: Born to Murder the World, Mistress, Monkeys Are Machine Guns, Fukpig, Professor Fate and Suffer Well. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kordhell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "name": "Danny Brown",
        "bio": "Daniel Dewan Sewell (born March 16, 1981), best known by his stage name Danny Brown, is a hip-hop artist from the Dexter-Linwood area of Detroit, Michigan. He has been described by MTV as \"one of rap's most unique figures in recent memory\". Danny is an unconventional hip-hop artist who employs multiple flows and cadences, thus the moniker “The Hybrid”. His style varies from low pitched gravelly tones to a manic, high-pitched squawk. His lyrics often deal with the truth of living in Detroit: poverty, drug abuse, desperate circumstances, etc. and his own experiences in the motor city, from selling drugs to underground parties in Detroit’s rave scene. He is known for juxtaposing those topics with a humorous narrative told ferociously over avant-garde production choices.\n\nDanny has released many free projects over the web, the most popular being 2011’s XXX. Brown released the album \"Hawaiian Snow” with G-Unit’s Tony Yayo and several mixtapes (Detroit State of Mind 1-4, Browntown, It’s A Art (with producer Mainframe) and Hot Soup). Brown has found much success on the internet through the support of the music blogs and social media and the decision to release “The Hybrid” online as a free download. \n\nDanny has worked with many artists in the Detroit hip-hop community such as the late J Dilla, Black Milk, Elzhi, Guilty Simpson, Trick Trick, and T3. Also known for championing up-and-coming artists, Danny has worked with lesser known acts such as Oakland, California's Main Attrakionz and is know for promoting these types of underground acts via his twitter.\n\nBrown spent most of the summer of 2010 touring with G-Unit, and a few months later released “Hawaiian Snow” with Tony Yayo. Due to lack of promotion the sales were disappointing, however through the G-Unit connection Brown was able to experience firsthand the rigors of touring and the workings of the music industry as a whole. The experience served to jade Danny to the concepts of being on a major label and committing himself to appealing to an urban audience who he felt rejected him because of his look and style of dress which consisted of skinny jeans and vintage tees as 50 Cent refused to sign Danny Brown to G-Unit because he didn’t approve of his distaste for baggy denim. No longer concentrating on appealing to any particular audience, With this new found freedom, Danny delved into making more experimental music based on influences like UK Grime and Progressive Rock.\n\nHis experimental sound melded with traditional street narrative has brought about attention from progressive press such as Pitchfork.com, Fader Magazine, Spin Magazine and the like but no press more satisfying than making the cover of the Detroit Metro Times, his hometown’s alternative art’s and culture magazine. \n\nDanny’s music later found a home on Fool’s Gold Records, the independent label helmed by internationally heralded DJ A-Trak and his partner Nick Catchdubs. The label and the artist having the same mindset, the two parties are now focused on releasing his upcoming projects, a free album that released Summer 2011 entitled “XXX” and his untitled Fool’s Gold records debut coming subsequently after.\n\nHis albums that followed also received positive feedback (Old, Atrocity Exhibition, U Know What I'm Sayin?).\n\nHe then sadly dunked on anyone else who had the misfortune to drop in the calendar year 2023 by dropping album of the decade Scaring the Hoes Vol. 1 with  JPEGMAFIA on March 24th. It tragically received praise from disgraced music reviewer the BallDrop, but contrarily to this otherwise mark of disgrace from the worst person we all have the displeasure to be aware of, the album actually fye asl.\n\nYou know he had to go two for two on the DLC of Scaring the Hoes on the sacred national holiday of 7/11. No skips all Ws and is not mixed like shit for the \"aesthetic\" anymore, and JPEGMAFIA dodges the corny allegations by making Danny audible. Great news all around.\n\nOn October 17th, he began the rollout for his highly anticapted sixth studio album with the single Tantor (fire as fuck). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

And it's gonna be a big deal\". Q-Tip, famous for being the main producer for New York hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, revealed his involvement with Brown's album during a guest appearance on Elton John's Rocket Hour show on Beats 1 radio on March 21, 2019. Brown initially began working with A Tribe Called Quest member Ali Shaheed Muhammad, before eventually working with Q-Tip instead. Brown later explained that the album and its title, uknowhatimsayin¿, doesn't have a concept; \"Half the time, when black people say, 'You know what I'm sayin''', they're never saying nothing  ... This is just songs. You don't have to listen to it backwards. You don't have to mix it a certain way.

The album's production was handled by Frank Dukes, Brandun DeShay, Skywlkr, Nick Speed, Quelle, Paul White, Squadda Bambino, and DJ House Shoes. The album's only guest appearances come from Brown's Bruiser Brigade cohorts Chips and Dopehead.\n\nXXX was released as a free download by Brooklyn, New York-based record label Fool's Gold Records. Brown cited XXX as his attempt at \"experimenting and seeing how far  could push listeners\" with his music. Brown explains that XXX is an effort at a serious concept album with a storyline, citing track 13 \"DNA\" as the start of Side B: \"The cover looked like a vinyl to me, so I was going with that whole vibe\". He explained that \"the first side is all having fun\" before the album takes a serious turn from \"DNA\" onward.\n\nWhile recording the album, Brown was listening to a lot of Joy Division. He has also stated he recorded XXX with the intent of having it critically acclaimed: \"I made XXX with the aim of getting great reviews.\"\n\nXXX received widespread acclaim from critics. On March 13, 2012, the album was re-released on iTunes with three new tracks and a digital booklet included.\n\nXXX was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 83, based on nine reviews.\n\nVincent Thomas of AllMusic wrote, \"XXX — named for his gutter-filthy mouth and his 30th birthday — is an accomplishment.\" Jack Law of Fact noted, \"It's Brown's embracing of contradictions that make him such a fascinating rapper, and XXX is given depth and longevity by a tension, or collision between hardcore rap's reality fix and the avant-garde's desire for creative and expressive freedom from reality.\" Patrick Taylor of RapReviews said, \"XXX is another excellent release from the man who is one of the best rappers out there, proving that you can be lyrical and street at the same time, and that hip-hop doesn't have to be one dimensional.\"\n\nDavid Amidon of PopMatters said, \"Beyond its confrontational veneer lies a 19-track collection of a good number of 2011's hardest, freshest, most concrete bars imaginable.\" Pitchfork wrote positively, \"His gleeful love of words not only elevates some pretty heavy subject matter; it also helps distinguish XXX as one of the most compelling indie rap releases in an already strong year.\" Will Robinson of Sputnikmusic also wrote, \"XXX is an absolutely essential hip-hop release in the age of Internet distribution and excess, and as the extreme of the lyrical tameness spectrum it's necessary for anyone who claims to be at all knowledgeable about hip-hop.\"\n\nPitchfork placed the album at number 19 on its list of the \"Top 50 albums of 2011\", while Spin named it the top hip-hop album of 2011. In October 2013, Complex named XXX the eighth-best hip-hop album of the last five years. In June 2016, Pitchfork placed the album at number three on its list of the \"50 Best Rap Mixtapes of the Millennium\" and in 2019, they placed it at 63 on their list of \"The Best 200 Albums of the 2010s\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/XXX+(Deluxe+Version)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Mixing up deep violent and thin psychotic flows, this work goes hard from the beginning to the very end. The first half of the album is focused on The Hybrid persona, with a lot of sarcastic humor, misogyny, and maniac rhymes. At a certain point, the album get really depressive and serious, reminding us that Danny has been under a lot of pressure and extreme situations in his life, and he knows how to rap about it. Funny fact is that the first word he says in the album is \"30\", in the opening song \"XXX\". In the last song, \"30\", the last thing he says, closing the record, is \"Triple X\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/XXX+(Deluxe+Edition)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "XXX (pronounced \"triple x\" or \"30\") is the second studio album by American rapper Danny Brown. It was released on August 15, 2011, by Fool's Gold Records. The album's production was handled by Frank Dukes, Brandun DeShay, Skywlkr, Nick Speed, Quelle, Paul White, Squadda Bambino, and DJ House Shoes. The album's only guest appearances come from Brown's Bruiser Brigade cohorts Chips and Dopehead.\n\nXXX was released as a free download by Brooklyn, New York-based record label Fool's Gold Records. Brown cited XXX as his attempt at \"experimenting and seeing how far  could push listeners\" with his music. Brown explains that XXX is an effort at a serious concept album with a storyline, citing track 13 \"DNA\" as the start of Side B: \"The cover looked like a vinyl to me, so I was going with that whole vibe\". He explained that \"the first side is all having fun\" before the album takes a serious turn from \"DNA\" onward.\n\nWhile recording the album, Brown was listening to a lot of Joy Division. He has also stated he recorded XXX with the intent of having it critically acclaimed: \"I made XXX with the aim of getting great reviews.\"\n\nXXX received widespread acclaim from critics. On March 13, 2012, the album was re-released on iTunes with three new tracks and a digital booklet included.\n\nXXX was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 83, based on nine reviews.\n\nVincent Thomas of AllMusic wrote, \"XXX — named for his gutter-filthy mouth and his 30th birthday — is an accomplishment.\" Jack Law of Fact noted, \"It's Brown's embracing of contradictions that make him such a fascinating rapper, and XXX is given depth and longevity by a tension, or collision between hardcore rap's reality fix and the avant-garde's desire for creative and expressive freedom from reality.\" Patrick Taylor of RapReviews said, \"XXX is another excellent release from the man who is one of the best rappers out there, proving that you can be lyrical and street at the same time, and that hip-hop doesn't have to be one dimensional.\"\n\nDavid Amidon of PopMatters said, \"Beyond its confrontational veneer lies a 19-track collection of a good number of 2011's hardest, freshest, most concrete bars imaginable.\" Pitchfork wrote positively, \"His gleeful love of words not only elevates some pretty heavy subject matter; it also helps distinguish XXX as one of the most compelling indie rap releases in an already strong year.\" Will Robinson of Sputnikmusic also wrote, \"XXX is an absolutely essential hip-hop release in the age of Internet distribution and excess, and as the extreme of the lyrical tameness spectrum it's necessary for anyone who claims to be at all knowledgeable about hip-hop.\"\n\nPitchfork placed the album at number 19 on its list of the \"Top 50 albums of 2011\", while Spin named it the top hip-hop album of 2011. In October 2013, Complex named XXX the eighth-best hip-hop album of the last five years. In June 2016, Pitchfork placed the album at number three on its list of the \"50 Best Rap Mixtapes of the Millennium\" and in 2019, they placed it at 63 on their list of \"The Best 200 Albums of the 2010s\".\n\nConsidered the best work yet released by Danny, this album is extremely raw hip-hop in its new school form. Mixing up deep violent and thin psychotic flows, this work goes hard from the beginning to the very end. The first half of the album is focused on the Hybrid persona, with a lot of sarcastic humor, misogyny, and psycho-maniac rhymes. At a certain point, the album gets really depressive and serious, reminding us that Danny has been under a lot of pressure and extreme situations in his life, and he knows how to rap about it. The funny fact is that the first word he says in the album is \"30\", in the opening song \"XXX\". In the last song, \"30\", the last thing he says, closing the record, is \"triple X\".

It shows a more serious and concerned Danny, talkin about life struggle and the (at the time, sad) situation of Detroit City. That's a great release for Danny's fans, because it marks the era of a more mature Brown, unlikely the critically aclaimed (also 2010s) \"The Hybrid\" mixtape, known for being the beggining of his extremelly \"non sense, agressive and junkie\" character, that mixed with the maturity achieved in \"Its A Art\" tape would converge in the 2011's \"XXX\" masterpiece album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/It%27s+A+Art\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "In this song, Danny deals with how messed up his life is and how he feels like constantly facing the devil. He acknowledges his substance abuse as something wrong, but he says he knows no other way. So, he reflects on his situation and laughs at it and continues his self-destructing behaviour anyway, as he is in too deep to get out, without serious help.\n\nThe song is the fourth single from \"Atrocity Exhibition\", and its video dropped on March 28, 2017. In celebration of Record Store Day, a 10\" vinyl pressing was released on April 22, backed with the acapella, instrumental and previously-released Clams Casino collab, “Worth It”.\n\nIn the Jonah Hill directed music video, following a format of a mock-sitcom, a dysfunctional family with Danny (the crazy uncle) having the same drug abuse problem is shown doing crazy activities, while the family deals with him, to amuse the live audience for cheap laughter. In the end, Danny kills off the family members and gets killed by the drugs he abuses, while a child character questions the morality of the audience (including us, in a sense) as to how we can enjoy this atrocity exhibition.\n\nThe acclaimed indie-punk artist Jeff Rosenstock, in a Facebook post in December 2016 as part of a series listing his favorite albums of the year, praised Atrocity Exhibition in general and had this to say about “Ain’t It Funny” specifically:\n\n“‘Ain’t It Funny’ is the most manic song I’ve heard all year. Danny Brown does a great job of matching the discomfort of his lyrics with tenseness in his beats, again, in a way no one else is doing right now. Or at least not this well.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/_/Ain%27t+It+Funny\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was in the studio and it was just an unfinished song. I was trying to figure out what I was gonna do with it—he just went to the studio and took it! Then it came back and he had a hook on it, a bridge, a 24, and then I reached out to Earl and Ab, you know what I’m saying, and we threw their verses on there. It’s really his song!“\n\nThe song originally premiered at a Danny Brown concert on September 18, 2016 before being aired on Hot 97 just days later.\n\n“When I was making XXX, my top three rappers—the three guys that I was like, “Damn, I think they might rap better than me”—were Ab-Soul, Kendrick, and Earl. The guys I looked at as competition are now my friends. We’re like the Four Horsemen.\n\nIt’s always good to have that posse cut on a rap album, more so than just having features all over it. I wanted to have that one classic posse cut.“\n\n- Danny Brown via Entertainment Weekly\n\nBlack Milk works mostly with Detroit rappers, but he’s had some pretty notable songs, including collaborations with Danny Brown and Kendrick Lamar—two of the rappers on “Really Doe.” <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/_/Really+Doe\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The way the beat came on, it sounded more like an intro beat than a song with a hook. It was an intro, so I wrote the intro to it. Everything was super-intentional, it wasn’t like nothing wasn’t planned. I wrote the intro and I wrote “30”, the outro last.“\n\nFrank Dukes says:\n\n““XXX” was taken from a bunch of different chops from random places. I chopped up a drum break and I played some random shit over it, and it ended up as it is. I loved what Danny did with it. It was a beat that a few other people recorded over, but he ended up getting the record. I think the song is a perfect precursor to what the album does, because the beat is rooted in boom-bap but has some more [creative] elements that make it work. “XXX” sets the tone. Danny did his high-pitched crazy voice on it, but he also shows both sides of himself, saying goofy shit but also saying some real shit.“ <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/_/XXX\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

I was thinking like a Quentin Tarantino movie when I heard the beat, you know how his movies always start off crazy and action-packed? I wanted the beginning to be wild and crazy, but still scare the shit out of you at the same time. I didn’t want to make a party, because to me it’s a party song! Dark ass party! It’d be a party song in hell. I didn’t want to make a party song about drugs that sounds cool, like a Juicy J song. The parts with celebrities…Wikipedia will take you a long way!“\n\nProducer SKYWLKR says the sample came from Melvin Bliss' “Synthetic Substitution“. A popular soul track, “Synthetic Substitution” was also sampled in Naughty By Nature’s hit “O.P.P.“, Wu-Tang Clan’s “Bring da Ruckus“, and G.O.O.D.

I wrote it more in a talky flow. The first version. And it was more of like, you know. It was just my version of doing a stand-up comedy set. It’s just jokes.“\n\n“When I was talking about signing with Fool’s Gold, Q-Tip was the one that put the battery in the back to tell them to make it happen, you know what I’m saying? So I think he always been following my music to this point, so once we started to start talking about this album, it’s always want to have an executive producer involved in it, just somebody to help out. And he just came the board. My managers just hooked it up, so shouts out Tip. Working with Q-Tip, man, it was a humbling experience because we always think you know everything but when you’re around somebody like such a legend like him you got to take his criticism to heart. He ain’t going to steer you down a wrong path when it comes to making music. This is his passion, just like us. I used to record songs and it was almost like trying to catch lightning in a bottle almost. I’d just want to probably just get one take and try to capture the emotion more so than getting all the words right. But with him, he like, “Nah, man. You only got so much time before you put this music out in the world, so might as well give it all the love and care that it needs before people start to hear it. Because it’s like, once you put it out, it’s over.” So he pays a lot of attention to detail. Now I see that in the product after you put a lot of work into something like that. I’m happy with the way everything turned out.“\n\n“Before, I felt like it almost had to be like I’m trying to do a séance or something. Man, I got to have the candles going, I got to have the right incense, the right show on in the background. But now, it’s like, “Man. I’m a pro at this shit, man.” I just sit down whenever I feel, because at the end of the day, I look at it like, “This ain’t you. This a talent. This is coming from a higher power, so who is you to sit around think you need all that shit just to make it happen? All you got to do it put the pen to the paper and it’s going to happen.” So that’s what I go for now. I look at more, not like a job I would say, but almost like getting reps. You know what I’m saying? Just being a pro, man. That’s how I look at it, man. You’ve got to train.“\n\n- Danny Brown via Genius Annotations <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/_/Dirty+Laundry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On March 28, 2023, Brown confirmed on his podcast that SCARING THE HOES was a way for him to release music while his own album, Quaranta, was \"caught up in label purgatory\". Further explaining, he claimed that he had turned in the album \"two weeks ago\" and its release was being held up his manager and Warp Records. On October 17, 2023, Brown released the \"Tantor\" as the lead single alongside a music video and the tracklist for Quaranta.\n\nIn the video, Brown evokes the lyric \"cyborg with vocal chords\" from \"Tantor\". The Rolling Stone described the \"surreal\" video as featuring the rapper \"walking around the city wearing satellites, keyboards, and electrical supplies — like a makeshift Power Ranger.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/_/Tantor\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "name": "Cream",
        "bio": "Cream was a 1960s three-piece British band consisting of bassist/lead vocalist Jack Bruce, guitarist/vocalist Eric Clapton, and drummer Ginger Baker, having formed in London, England. They were known as one of the first great power trios and supergroups of rock. Their sound was characterised by a hybrid of blues, hard rock and psychedelic rock. Cream combined Clapton's blues guitar playing with the powerful and airy voice and intense bass lines of Jack Bruce and the manic drumming of Ginger Baker. They have sold over 35 million albums worldwide. Wheels of Fire was the world's first platinum-selling double album.\nBaker, Bruce, and Clapton named their band \"Cream\" because they thought themselves as the \"cream of the crop\" of their respective instruments.\n\nCream's music included songs based on traditional blues such as \"Crossroads\" and \"Spoonful\", and modern blues such as \"Born Under a Bad Sign\" and \"Outside Woman Blues\" as well as more eccentric songs such as \"Strange Brew\", \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" and \"Toad\". Cream's biggest hits were \"I Feel Free\" (UK, #11)[4], \"Sunshine of Your Love\" (US, #5)[5], \"White Room\" (US, #6)[5], \"Crossroads\" (US, #28)[5], and \"Badge\" (UK, #18).\n\nCream, together with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, made a significant impact upon the popular music of the time, providing a heavy yet technically proficient musical theme that foreshadowed the emergence of bands such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and The Jeff Beck Group in the late 1960s. The band's live performances influenced progressive rock acts such as Rush, jam bands such as The Allman Brothers Band, Grateful Dead and Phish, and heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.\n\nCream were ranked #16 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.\n\nBy July of 1966, Eric Clapton's career with The Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers had earned him a reputation as the premier blues guitarist in Britain.[2] Clapton's virtuosity and raw power with the instrument inspired one fan to spray paint the words \"Clapton is God\" on the wall of an Islington underground station.[7] Clapton, however, found the environment of Mayall's band confining, and sought to expand his playing in a new band.\n\nIn 1966, Clapton met Baker, then the leader of the Graham Bond Organisation, which at one point featured Jack Bruce on bass, harmonica and piano. Baker, too, felt stifled in the GBO, and had grown tired of Graham Bond's drug addictions and bouts of mental instability. \"I had always liked Ginger\", explained Clapton. \"Ginger had come to see me play with John Mayall. After the gig he drove me back to London in his Rover. I was very impressed with his car and driving. He was telling me that he wanted to start a band, and I had been thinking about it too.\"[8] Each was impressed with the other's playing abilities, prompting Baker to ask Clapton to join his new, then-unnamed group. Clapton immediately agreed, on the condition that Baker hire Jack Bruce as the group's bassist[4]; according to Clapton, when he made the suggestion, Baker almost crashed the car.[9]\n\nClapton had met Bruce when the bassist/vocalist did a short stint with the Bluesbreakers in March 1966[4]; the two had also worked together as part of a one-shot band called Powerhouse (which also included Steve Winwood and Paul Jones). Impressed with Bruce's vocals and technical prowess, Clapton had wanted to work with him on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhat Clapton did not know was that while Bruce was in Bond's band, he and Baker had been notorious for their quarreling.[10] While both were excellent jazz musicians and respected each other's skills, the confines of the GBO had proved too small for their egos. Their volatile relationship included on-stage fights and the sabotage of one another's instruments.[10] After Baker fired Bruce from the band, Bruce continued to arrive for gigs; ultimately, Bruce was driven away from the band after Baker threatened him at knifepoint.\n\nNevertheless, Baker and Bruce were able to put aside their differences for the good of Baker's new trio, which he envisioned as collaborative, with each of the members contributing to music and lyrics. The band was named \"Cream\", as Clapton, Bruce, and Baker were already considered the \"cream of the crop\" amongst blues and jazz musicians in the exploding British music scene. Before deciding upon \"Cream\", the band considered calling themselves \"Sweet 'n' Sour Rock 'n' Roll\". Of the trio, Clapton had the biggest reputation in England; however, he was all but unknown in the United States. He left The Yardbirds before \"For Your Love\" hit the American Top Ten.[2]\n\nCream made their unofficial debut at the Twisted Wheel on 29 July 1966.[4][11] Their official debut came two nights later at the Sixth Annual Windsor Jazz & Blues Festival.[4][11] Being new and with few original songs to their credit, Cream performed spirited blues reworkings that thrilled the large crowd and earned them a warm reception. In October, they also got a chance to jam with Jimi Hendrix, who had recently arrived in London. Hendrix was a fan of Clapton's music, and wanted a chance to play with him onstage.[4] Hendrix was introduced to Cream through Chas Chandler, the bassist of The Animals, who was Hendrix's manager.[4]\n\nIt was during the early organisation that they decided Bruce would serve as the group's lead vocalist. While Clapton was shy about singing[12], he occasionally harmonised with Bruce and, in time, took lead vocals on some notable Cream tunes including \"Four Until Late\"[13], \"Strange Brew\"[14], \"Crossroads\"[15], and \"Badge\"[16]\n\nFresh Cream\n\nCream's debut album, Fresh Cream, was recorded and released in 1966. The album reached #6 in the UK charts and #39 in the United States.[17] It mainly consisted of blues covers, including \"Four Until Late\", \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\" (written by Muddy Waters), \"Spoonful\" (written by Willie Dixon and recorded by Howlin' Wolf), \"I'm So Glad\" and \"Cat's Squirrel\".[18] The rest of the album featured songs written (or co-written) by Jack Bruce, most notably \"Wrapping Paper\" and \"I Feel Free\" (which was a UK hit single[4], but only released on the American edition of the LP), and a couple of songs written by Ginger Baker (one of which, \"Toad\", contained one of the earliest examples of a drum solo in rock music).\n\nThe early Cream bootlegs show that the band had not developed their signature jamming capabilities. These recordings capture a much tighter band showcasing more songs. All of the songs are reasonably short five-minute versions of \"N.S.U.\", \"Sweet Wine\" and \"Toad\". But a mere two months later, the setlist had been shortened with the songs now much longer.\n\n\nCream first visited the United States in March 1967 to play nine dates at the RKO Theater in New York. They returned to record Disraeli Gears in New York between 11 May and 15 May 1967. Cream's second album was released in November 1967 and reached the Top 5 in the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.[19] Produced by Felix Pappalardi (who later co-founded the Cream-inspired quartet Mountain) and engineer Tom Dowd, it was recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York. Disraeli Gears is often considered to be the band's defining effort, successfully blending psychedelic British rock with American blues. It was also the first Cream album to consist primarily of original songs, with only three of the eleven tracks written by others outside the band. Disraeli Gears not only features hits \"Strange Brew\" and \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\", but also \"Sunshine of Your Love\".\n\nAlthough the album is considered one of Cream's finest efforts, it is not well represented in Cream's live sets. Although they consistently played \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" and \"Sunshine of Your Love\", a setlist consisting of several songs from Disraeli Gears was quickly dropped from the set in mid-1967, favouring longer blues jams instead of short pop songs. Only \"We're Going Wrong\" saw some occasional play time in their live sets. In fact, at their 2005 reunion shows, Cream only played three songs from Disraeli Gears: \"Outside Woman Blues,\" \"We're Going Wrong,\" and \"Sunshine of Your Love.\"\n\nIn late 1967, they incorporated more jamming time in their repertoire, some songs stretching out to 20 minutes. According to Jack Bruce, they were obliged to play 20-minute jams or the audience would angrily ask for their money back. Long drawn-out jams in songs like \"Spoonful\", \"N.S.U.\" and \"Sweet Wine\" became live favorites. Nonetheless, songs like \"Sunshine of Your Love\", \"Crossroads\", and \"Tales of Brave Ulysses\" remained reasonably short.\n\nDisraeli Gears\n\nDisraeli Gears is the second album by British blues-rock group Cream. It was released in November 1967 and went on to reach #5 on the UK album chart. It was also their American breakthrough, becoming a massive seller there in 1968, reaching #4 on the American charts. The album features the two singles “Strange Brew” and “Sunshine of Your Love”. By this time, the group was veering quite heavily away from their blues roots to indulge in more psychedelic sounds.\n\nWheels of Fire\n\nIn 1968 came Cream's third release, Wheels of Fire, which topped the American charts. Wheels of Fire showcased Cream moving slightly away from the blues and more towards a semi-progressive rock style highlighted by odd time signatures and various orchestral instruments. However, the band did record a live blues favorite, \"Sitting on Top of the World\". The opening song, \"White Room\", became a popular radio staple. Another song, \"Politician\", was written by the band while waiting to perform live at the BBC.[8] According to a BBC interview with Clapton, the record company, also handling Albert King, asked the band to cover \"Born Under a Bad Sign\", which became a popular track off the record.\n\nThe album's second disc featured three live recordings from the Winterland Ballroom and one from the Fillmore. Eric Clapton's solo in \"Crossroads\" has made it to the top 20 in multiple \"greatest guitar solo\" lists.[20][21][22] The 16-minute \"Spoonful\", from their March Winterland show, became their most epic song and a concert favourite. Ginger Baker's \"Toad\" is now widely-regarded as one of the greatest live drum solos in rock history[citation needed].\n\nAfter the completion of Wheels of Fire in mid-1968, the band members had had enough and wanted to go their separate ways. As Baker would state in a 2006 interview with Music Mart magazine, \"It just got to the point where Eric said to me: 'I've had enough of this,' and I said so have I. I couldn't stand it. The last year with Cream was just agony. It's damaged my hearing permanently, and today I've still got a hearing problem because of the sheer volume throughout the last year of Cream. But it didn't start off like that. In 1966, it was great. It was really a wonderful experience musically, and it just went into the realms of stupid.\" Also, Bruce and Baker's combustible relationship proved even worse as a result of the strain put upon the band by non-stop touring, forcing Clapton to play the perpetual role of peacekeeper.\n\nClapton had also fallen under the spell of Bob Dylan's former backing group, now known as The Band, and their debut album, Music from Big Pink[4], which proved to be a welcome breath of fresh air in comparison to the incense and psychedelia that had informed Cream. Furthermore, he had read a scathing Cream review in Rolling Stone magazine, a publication he had much admired, where the reviewer, Jon Landau, called him a master of \"the blues cliché.\"[4] It was in the wake of that article that Clapton wanted to end Cream and pursue a different musical direction.\n\nAt the beginning of their farewell tour on 4 October 1968, in Oakland, nearly the entire set consisted of songs from Wheels of Fire: \"White Room\", \"Politician\", \"Crossroads\", \"Spoonful\", \"Deserted Cities of the Heart\", and \"Passing the Time\" taking place of \"Toad\" for a drum solo. \"Passing the Time\" and \"Deserted Cities\" were quickly removed from the setlist and replaced by \"Sitting on Top of the World\" and \"Toad\".\n\nGoodbye\n\nCream was eventually persuaded to do one final album. That album, the appropriately titled Goodbye, was recorded in late 1968 and released in early 1969, after the band had broken up. It featured six songs: three live recordings dating from a concert at The Forum in Los Angeles, California, on 19 October, and three new studio recordings (the most notable, \"Badge\", was written by Clapton and George Harrison, who also played rhythm guitar). \"I'm So Glad\", which first appeared as a studio recording on Fresh Cream, appeared as a live track on Goodbye. It was the only song to appear on both Cream's first and last albums.\n\nCream's \"farewell tour\" consisted of 22 shows at 19 venues in the United States between 4 October and 4 November 1968, and two final farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 November 1968. Initially another double album was planned, comprising live material from this tour plus new studio tracks, but a single album, Goodbye was released instead with three live tracks taken from their performance at The Forum in Los Angeles on 19 October 1968, and three studio tracks, one written by each of the band members. The final United States gig was at the Rhode Island Auditorium, 4 November 1968.\n\nThe two Royal Albert Hall concerts were filmed for a BBC documentary and released on video (and later DVD) as Farewell Concert. Both shows were sold out and attracted more attention than any other Cream concert, but their performance was regarded by many as below standard. Baker himself said of the concerts: \"It wasn’t a good gig ... Cream was better than that ... We knew it was all over. We knew we were just finishing it off, getting it over with.\" Cream's live performances were already declining. In an interview from Cream: Classic Artists, Ginger Baker himself agreed that the band was getting worse by the minute.[23]\n\nCream's supporting acts were Taste (featuring a young Rory Gallagher) and the newly formed Yes, who received good reviews.\n\nBreakup\n\nFrom its creation, Cream was faced with some fundamental problems that would later lead to its dissolution in November 1968. The rivalry between Bruce and Baker created tensions in the band. Clapton also felt that the members of the band did not listen to each other enough. Clapton once told a story that when Cream were playing in a concert, he stopped playing and neither Baker nor Bruce noticed.[10] Cream decided that it would break up in May of 1968 during a tour of the US.[24] Later, in July, an official announcement was made that the band would break up after a farewell tour of the United States and after playing two concerts in London. Cream finished its tour of the United States with a 4 November concert in Rhode Island and performed in the UK for the last time in London on 25 and 26 November.[24]\n\nReunions (1993, 2005)\n\nIn 1993, Cream was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and set aside their differences to perform at the induction ceremony.[25] Initially, the trio was wary about performing, until encouraging words from Robbie Robertson inspired them to try. The end result was an incendiary set consisting of \"Sunshine of Your Love\", \"Crossroads\", and - interestingly, as the band had never played it live during their original tenure - \"Born Under a Bad Sign\". Clapton mentioned in his acceptance speech that their rehearsal the day before the ceremony had marked the first time they had played together in 25 years.[4]\nCream backstage at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.\n\nThe performance spurred rumours of a reunion tour. Bruce and Baker went so far as to say in later interviews that they were, indeed, interested in touring as Cream. A formal reunion did not take place immediately, however, and Clapton continued to pursue solo projects, as did Bruce and Baker, although the two did work together again in the mid-1990s as two-thirds of a power trio, BBM, with Gary Moore.\n\nIn 2004, it was officially announced that Cream would finally reunite for a series of four shows, on 2, 3, 5, and 6 May 2005 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, the venue of their final concerts in 1968. Even more surprising was that the reunion came at Clapton's request: although the three musicians chose not to speak publicly about the shows, Clapton would later state that he had become more \"generous\" in regard to his past, and that the physical health of Bruce and Baker was a major factor: Bruce had recently undergone a liver transplant for liver cancer, and had almost lost his life, while Baker had severe arthritis.\n\nTickets for all four shows sold out in under an hour. Touts were soon charging outrageous prices for what became one of the hardest-to-get tickets in rock and roll history. The performances were recorded for a live CD and DVD. Among those in attendance were Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Steve Winwood, Roger Waters, Brian May of Queen, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin and also Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman, formerly of the Rolling Stones. The reunion marked the first time the band had played \"Badge\" and \"Pressed Rat and Warthog\" live.\n\nThe Royal Albert Hall reunion proved a success on both a personal and financial level, inspiring the reformed band to bring their reunion to the United States. For reasons unknown, Cream chose to play at only one venue, Madison Square Garden in New York City, from 24-26 October 2005. The shows were marred by some controversy in regard to tickets: the show's promoters had made a deal with credit card company American Express to make tickets available to American Express customers only in an unprecedented week-long pre-sale. Again, touts charged high prices for tickets; nevertheless, the shows were a financial success and received critical praise.\n\nFans of Cream hoped for a full-scale tour, but a statement from Cream's publicist days after the last performance put the nail in that particular coffin, when it was announced that Cream would not tour the United States. In an interview with Jack Bruce in the December 2005 issue of Bass Player magazine, Bruce hinted that he would like to see Cream continue in one way or another, possibly in the form of a new album, but that a tour was out of the question: \"It would be quite a challenge to try to create music that would stand up to the classic songs. I've got a few ideas already — in fact, I wrote a song yesterday that I think would work. I just don't know if it will happen, because we all feel the band is so special we don't want to do it that often, if we go on. We've had offers you wouldn't believe — I didn't believe — for long world tours, and it's tempting. But none of us wants to accept because it would take away from the rarity and special nature of getting together. I'd like to do it every now and again and just play somewhere, but we could do an album amidst that, and I'm going to suggest it.\"\n\nPost-Cream\n\nLater years (1968-present)\n\nBlind Faith came about immediately after the demise of Cream following an attempt by Clapton to recruit Steve Winwood into the band in the hope that he would help act as a buffer between Bruce and Baker. However, Cream broke up before Winwood had the chance to consider the offer.\n\nInspired by more song-based acts, particularly The Band, Clapton went on to perform much different, less improvisational material with Delaney & Bonnie, Derek and the Dominos and in his own long and varied solo career.\n\nJack Bruce began a varied and successful solo career with the 1969 release of Songs for a Tailor.\n\nGinger Baker formed a jazz-fusion ensemble out of the ashes of Blind Faith, Ginger Baker's Air Force, which featured Winwood, Blind Faith bassist Rick Grech, Graham Bond on sax, and Denny Laine of the Moody Blues, among others.\n\nThe future (2006-present)\n\nCream's future is uncertain: in February 2006, Cream received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of their contribution to, and influence upon, modern music. That same month, a \"Classic Albums\" DVD was released detailing the story behind the creation and recording of Disraeli Gears. On the day prior to the Grammy ceremony, Bruce made a public statement that more one-off performances of Cream had been planned: multiple dates in a few cities, similar to the Royal Albert Hall and Madison Square Garden shows. He would not state when or where those shows would occur, claiming that he \"would get chopped\" if he said anything.\n\nHowever, this story was rebutted by both Clapton and Baker, first by Clapton in a Times article from April 2006. The article stated that when asked about Cream, Clapton said: \"'No. Not for me. We did it and it was fun. But life is too short I've got lots of other things I would rather do, including staying at home with my kids.' The thing about that band, he says, was that it was all to do with its limits. 'Here were three people who were essentially in disagreement with each other. You latched on to those rare moments of cohesion and made the most of them. But they were rare. It was an experiment.'\"\n\nIn an interview regarding the release of a DVD of Blind Faith's 1969 performance in Hyde Park, Baker commented to the United Kingdom-based magazine Music Mart about his unwillingness to continue the Cream reunion. These comments were far more specific and explosive than Clapton's; his reasons stemmed from Jack Bruce's behaviour at the Madison Square Garden performances: \"When he's Dr. Jekyll, he's fine... It's when he's Mr. Hyde that he's not. And I'm afraid he's still the same. I tell you this - there won't ever be any more Cream gigs, because he did Mr. Hyde in New York last year.\"\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, Baker replied: \"Oh, he shouted at me on stage, he turned his bass up so loud that he deafened me on the first gig. What he does is that he apologises and apologises, but I'm afraid, to do it on a Cream reunion gig, that was the end. He killed the magic, and New York was like 1968... It was just a get through the gig, get the money sort of deal. I was absolutely amased. I mean, he demonstrated why he got the sack from Graham Bond and why Cream didn't last very long on stage in New York. I didn't want to do it in the first place simply because of how Jack was. I have worked with him several times since Cream, and I promised myself that I would never work with him again. When Eric first came up with the idea, I said no, and then he phoned me up and eventually convinced me to do it. I was on my best behaviour and I did everything I could to make things go as smooth as possible, and I was really pleasant to Jack.\"\n\nClapton would later expand on his reasons for ending the reunion: Baker's response to Bruce's attitude on the first night of the New York shows. Believing that the two would never see eye-to-eye almost forty years after the break-up of Cream, he chose to return to the path of solo artist. Surprisingly, despite the negative comments from Baker regarding Madison Square Garden, Jack Bruce told Detroit's WCSX radio station in May 2007 that there are plans for a Cream reunion later in the year: \"There is some talk about us getting together later this year, which I can't really say too much about. But it's not a commercial thing ... but we may get together for something.\"\n\nIt was later revealed that the potential performance was to be a set at the November, 2007 London tribute to Ahmet Ertegün. The band decided against it, as was confirmed by Bruce in a letter to the editor of the Jack Bruce fanzine, The Cuicoland Express dated 26 September 2007:\n\n    \"Dear Marc,\n    We were going to do this tribute concert for Ahmet when it was to be at the Royal Albert Hall but decided to pass when it was moved to the O2 Arena and seemed to be becoming overly commercial.\"\n\nThe headlining act for the O2 Arena Ertegun tribute show (postponed to December 2007) turned out to be another reunited English hard-rock act, Led Zeppelin.\n\nThere's another artist with the same name:\n\n2. Cream is a Japanese hip hop group consisting of singer-songwriter Minami and rapper/track-maker Staxx T. Their musical style is influenced by hip-hop, pop, rock, and electronic dance music -- which they collectively refer to as \"new jpop.\" The group takes its name from a fusion of the words \"creative\" and \"team\".  This is to reveal that CREAM is a creative team that not only produces music for themselves, but also for other artists. They usually work together but they also work individually, writing lyrics and composing music for various artists including m-flo, BoA, V6 ,MADEMOISELLE YULIA (KOZM ®), etc. CREAM is also known for their youtube channel “CREAM VISION.” CREAM VISION is a channel made by CREAM, where they cover/ remix songs from all over the world in Japanese as well as upload original songs. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cream\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Disraeli Gears is the second album by British blues-rock group Cream. It was released in November 1967 and went on to reach #5 on the UK album chart. It was also their American breakthrough, becoming a massive seller there in 1968, reaching #4 on the American charts. The album features the two singles \"Strange Brew\" and \"Sunshine of Your Love\". By this time, the group was veering quite heavily away from their blues roots to indulge in more psychedelic sounds.\n\nThe title of the album was taken from an inside joke. Eric Clapton had been thinking of buying a racing bicycle and was discussing it with Ginger Baker, when a roadie named Mick Turner commented, \"it's got them Disraeli Gears\", meaning to say \"derailleur gears,\" but instead alluding to 19th Century British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli. The band thought this was hilarious, and decided that it should be the title of their next album. Had it not been for Mick's turn of phrase, the album would simply have been entitled \"Cream.\"\n\nClapton, Baker, and Jack Bruce all contributed songs with the help of lyricist Pete Brown and producer Felix Pappalardi. The track \"Blue Condition\" was unusual in that Baker, although not well known for his singing, took the lead vocal. The album was recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York during May 1967, following the band's nine shows as part of Murray the K's \"Music in the 5th Dimension\" concert series. Cream's American label, ATCO, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlantic Records.\n\nThe psychedelic cover art was created by Australian artist Martin Sharp, who lived in the same building as Clapton at the time of the Chelsea artists colony The Pheasantry. At their first meeting in a London club, Clapton mentioned that he had some music that needed lyrics, so Sharp wrote out a poem he had composed on a napkin and gave it to Clapton, who recorded it as \"Tales of Brave Ulysses.\"\n\nWhen interviewed on the episode of the VH1 show, Classic Albums, which featured Disraeli Gears, Bruce stated that when writing the song \"Take it Back\", he had been inspired by the contemporary media images of American students burning their draft cards and wrote the song in that spirit of rejecting militarism.\n\nIn 2004, the album was released as a 2-disc Deluxe edition including the complete album in both mono and stereo, demos, alternate takes and tracks taken from the band's live sessions on BBC radio. In 2003 the album was ranked number 112 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. VH1 also named it their 87th greatest album of all time the same year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cream/Disraeli+Gears\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Wheels of Fire is the name of a double album recorded by Cream. The release was largely successful, scoring the band a #3 peak in the UK and a #1 in the US, and became the world's first platinum-selling double album.\nIf Disraeli Gears was the album where Cream came into their own, its successor, Wheels of Fire, finds the trio in full fight, capturing every side of their multi-faceted personality, even hinting at the internal pressures that soon would tear the band asunder. A dense, unwieldy double album split into an LP of new studio material and an LP of live material, it's sprawling and scattered, at once awesome in its achievement and maddening in how it falls just short of greatness. It misses its goal not because one LP works and the other doesn't, but because both the live and studio sets suffer from strikingly similar flaws, deriving from the constant power struggle between the trio. Of the three, Ginger Baker comes up short, contributing the passable \"Passing the Time\" and \"Those Were the Days,\" which are overshadowed by how he extends his solo drum showcase \"Toad\" to a numbing quarter of an hour and trips upon the Wind & the Willows whimsy of \"Pressed Rat and Warthog,\" whose studied eccentricity pales next to Eric Clapton's nimble, eerily cheerful \"Anyone for Tennis.\" In almost every regard, Wheels of Fire is a terrific showcase for Clapton as a guitarist, especially on the first side of the live album with \"Crossroads,\" a mighty encapsulation of all of his strengths. Some of that is studio trickery, as producer Felix Pappalardi cut together the best bits of a winding improvisation to a tight four minutes, giving this track a relentless momentum that's exceptionally exciting, but there's no denying that Clapton is at a peak here, whether he's tearing off solos on a 17-minute \"Spoonful\" or goosing \"White Room\" toward the heights of madness. But it's the architect of \"White Room,\" bassist Jack Bruce, who, along with his collaborator Peter Brown, reaches a peak as a songwriter. Aside from the monumental \"White Room,\" he has the lovely, wistful \"As You Said,\" the cinematic \"Deserted Cities of the Heart,\" and the slow, cynical blues \"Politician,\" all among Cream's very best work. And in many ways Wheels of Fire is indeed filled with Cream's very best work, since it also captures the fury and invention (and indulgence) of the band at its peak on the stage and in the studio, but as it tries to find a delicate balance between these three titanic egos, it doesn't quite add up to something greater than the sum of its parts. But taken alone, those individual parts are often quite tremendous.\nThe album was also released as Wheels of Fire (In the Studio) and Wheels of Fire (Live at the Fillmore) as two single albums, released together, with similar cover art except: In the UK, the studio album was black print on aluminium foil, while the Live at the Fillmore album was a negative image of the studio cover. In Japan, the studio album was black on gold foil, while the live album was black on aluminium foil. In Australia, both covers were laminated copies of the Japanese releases (it was never released as a double album in Australia). In 2003, the album was ranked number 203 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\nThe sleeve was designed by Australian pop artist and cartoonist Martin Sharp, and it won the New York Art Directors Prize for Best Album Design in 1969. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cream/Wheels+of+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Fresh Cream represents so many different firsts, it’s difficult to keep count. Cream, of course, was the first supergroup, but their first album not only gave birth to the power trio, it also was instrumental in the birth of heavy metal and the birth of jam rock.\n- Stephen Thomas Erlewine/AMG (4/5 Stars) -\n\nFresh Cream is the debut studio album by British supergroup Cream. It was the first LP release of producer Robert Stigwood’s new “Independent” Reaction Records label, released in the UK as both a mono and stereo version on 9 December 1966, the same time as the single release of “I Feel Free”. The album was released a month later, in January 1967, in the United States by Atco Records as both a mono and a stereo version.\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 101 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\nFresh Cream represents so many different firsts, it's difficult to keep count. Cream, of course, was the first supergroup, but their first album not only gave birth to the power trio, it also was instrumental in the birth of heavy metal and the birth of jam rock. That's a lot of weight for one record and, like a lot of pioneering records, Fresh Cream doesn't seem quite as mighty as what would come later, both from the group and its acolytes. In retrospect, the moments on the LP that are a bit unformed -- in particular, the halting waltz of \"Dreaming\" never achieves the sweet ethereal atmosphere it aspires to -- stand out more than the innovations, which have been so thoroughly assimilated into the vocabulary of rock & roll, but Fresh Cream was a remarkable shift forward in rock upon its 1966 release and it remains quite potent. Certainly at this early stage the trio was still grounded heavily in blues, only fitting given guitarist Eric Clapton's stint in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, which is where he first played with bassist Jack Bruce, but Cream never had the purist bent of Mayall, and not just because they dabbled heavily in psychedelia. The rhythm section of Bruce and Ginger Baker had a distinct jazzy bent to their beat; this isn't hard and pure, it's spongy and elastic, giving the musicians plenty of room to roam. This fluidity is most apparent on the blues covers that take up nearly half the record, especially on \"Spoonful,\" where the swirling instrumental interplay, echo, fuzz tones, and overwhelming volume constitute true psychedelic music, and also points strongly toward the guitar worship of heavy metal. Almost all the second side of Fresh Cream is devoted to this, closing with Baker's showcase \"Toad,\" but for as hard and restless as this half of the album is, there is some lightness on the first portion of the record where Bruce reveals himself as an inventive psychedelic pop songwriter with the tense, colorful \"N.S.U.\" and the hook- and harmony-laden \"I Feel Free.\" Cream shows as much force and mastery on these tighter, poppier tunes as they do on the free-flowing jams, yet they show a clear bias toward the long-form blues numbers, which makes sense: they formed to be able to pursue this freedom, which they do so without restraint. If at times that does make the album indulgent or lopsided, this is nevertheless where Cream was feeling their way forward, creating their heavy psychedelic jazz-blues and, in the process, opening the door to all kinds of serious rock music that may have happened without Fresh Cream, but it just would not have happened in the same fashion as it did with this record as precedent.\n\nLP Track Listing\n\n    A1 I Feel Free -- 2:52\n    A2 N.S.U. -- 2:44\n    A3 Sleepy Time Time -- 4:20\n    A4 Dreaming -- 2:00\n    A5 Sweet Wine -- 3:18\n    A6 Cat's Squirrel -- 3:05\n    A7 Four Until Late -- 2:06\n    A8 Rollin' And Tumblin' -- 4:42\n\n    B1 I'm So Glad -- 3:58\n    B2 Toad -- 5:10\n    B3 Spoonful -- 6:37 (LP bonus track)\n    B4 Wrapping Paper -- 2:22 (LP bonus track)\n    B5 The Coffee Song -- 2:44 (LP bonus track)\n    B6 Rollin' And Tumblin' (mono) -- 4:42 (LP bonus track)\n\n\nNotes\n    Limited edition, 180+ pure virgin vinyl analogue pressing.\n    Remastered by Steve Hoffman on all vacuum-tube cutting system.\n    Contains bonus tracks (B3-B6).\n    The noise in N.S.U. is on master tape.\n    I'm So Glad was originally mixed to mono only.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nCream\n    Eric Clapton - guitar, vocals\n    Jack Bruce - vocals, bass, harmonica, piano, cello\n    Ginger Baker - drums, percussion, vocals\n\nProduction\n    Robert Stigwood - Producer\n    John Timperly - Engineer\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cream/Fresh+Cream\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "FROM A CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVE,\nit's startling to realize that Cream only existed for a little over two years, from mid-1966 to late1968. But, during a period in which rock music was evolving and mutating at a dizzyingly rapid rate, the pioneering British trio attained staggering levels of creativity and influence.\n\nIn its brief but eventful existence, Cream – Eric Clapton (guitar and vocals), Jack Bruce (bass and vocals) and Ginger Baker (drums) – released four groundbreaking albums that helped to radically redraw rock's stylistic and conceptual parameters. Meanwhile, their fiery live performances introduced improvisation to the rock arena, establishing Cream as the first band to fully explore the possibilities of the power-trio format. In the process, the group played a crucial role in laying the grounwork for the hard-rock and heavy metal that would flourish in decades to come.\n\nBeginning as imaginative blues revivalists, Cream quickly evolved into a far riskier, more challenging unit. Mining an audacious assortment of blues, jazz, folk, pop and psychedelic elements, Cream made adventurous, original music that reflected the restless energy of its era, yet continues to resonate nearly four decades later.\n\nClapton's incendiary, precedent-setting guitar work gave Cream its flashiest selling point. But the threesome's musical identity was shaped equally by the innovative rhythm section of Bruce, whose commanding voice, distinctive songwriting and aggressive, melodic bass playing drove many of their best-known tunes; and Baker, whose idiosyncratic, massively influental drumming ranged from nimble, jazz-informed swing to primal pounding.\n\nThe visionary trio's recorded legacy often seems to document two parallel groups: the wildly experimental studio outfit, and the tripped-down live trio. This career-spanning collection spotlights both sides of the Cream catalog, combining 21 newly remastered studio classics (Disc One: In the Studio) along with eight historic live performances (Disc Two: Live) to present a definitive portrait of this remarkable band.\n\nAltough Cream's success would quickly eclipse the three musician's previous endeavors, Clapton, Bruce and Baker already possessed imposing résumés when they launched Cream in July 1966. Clapton's work with the Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers had already made him a hero on the London blues-revival scene. Bruce had played alongside Clapton in the Bluesbakers, and with Baker in Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated and the Graham Bond Organisation; he'd also tasted pop success during a short stint with Manfred Mann. Baker had also played with trad jazz bandleaders Acker Bilk and Terry Lightfoot, before replacing Charlie Watts in Blues Incorporated.\n\nWhile Clapton had once quit the Yardbirds in protest when they strayed from blues basics, by 1966 he, Baker and Bruce were eager to break free from their prior combo's strict R&B/blues structures. Cream was designed to allow for more stylistic, compositional and improvisational freedom, a fact that became apparent on their debut LP Fresh Cream. The album, recorded between Luly and September of 1966, was dominated by the band's reworkings of American blues standards, notably Skip James “I'm So Glad,” which gets a punchy, compact four minute treatment that scarcely hints at the extended live number that the song would soon become.\n\nImpressive as their blues interpretations are, Cream's musical agenda is better represented by such a s “I Feel Free,” an irresistible slice of pop psychedelia penned by Bruce and frequent collaborator Pete Brown. Bruce's “N.S.U.” which shifts from singsongy playfulness to swooping operatics, is similarly electic, as is the propulsive “Sweet Wine,” which Baker co-wrote with Bruce's then-wife Janet Godfrey.\n\nWhile Fresh Cream was a formidable debut, it was on their second longplayer Disraeli Gears that Cream truly came into its own. Recorded in a mere six days during April and May of 1967, the album downplayed the group's revivalist inclinations in favor vividly inventive originals. With key contributions from American producer Felix Pappalardi (who'd later form the Cream-inspired trio Mountain) and engineer Tom Dowd, Disraeli Gears was the album that brought Cream to mainstream attention in the U.S., and still considered by many to be the band's creative peak.\nBruce wrote or co-wrote five of the album's nine originals, singing lead on his own slow-burning “We're Going Wrong”; the moody “World of Pain,” written by Pappalardi and wife Gail Collins; and the Bruce/Brown composition “Swlabr.” The latter is a marvel of acid surrealism whose lyrical imagery lives up to the conceit of its title, an acronym for “She Walks Like a Bearded Rainbow.”\n\nBruce also delivers a gripping vocal on “Tales of Brave Ulysses,” co-written by Clapton and album-cover artist Martin Sharp, whose colorful lyrics recast Homer's Odyssey as a psychedelic fever dream. Clapton's “Strange Brew” is both earthy and mystical; it had begun life as a straight blues track, “Lawdy Mama,” before being rewritten with a retooled melody and new lyrics by Collins.\n\nBy mainstream listeners, though Disraeli Gears' calling card was “Sunshine of Your Love,” co-written by Bruce, Clapton and Brown. The complex yet catchy tune finds the bassist and guitarist trading vocals on the verses and harmonizing on the chorus, while Clapton and the rhythm section wrestle with an instrumental hook whose genius lies in its simplicity. As a single, “Sunshine of Your Love” initially only scraped the lower reaches of the U.S. Top 40, but became a Top Five hit when it was reissued in mid-1968.\n\nThe summer of 1968 saw the release of the ambitious double LP Wheels of Fire, a sprawling epic combining separate discs of studio and live material. The studio sides, produced again by Pappalardi, spawned the band's second Top Ten single in Bruce and Brown's “White Room,” whose haunting lyric is matched by Bruce's keening vocal and Clapton's howling guitar pyrotechnics. The Bruce/Brown compositions “Politician” and “Deserted Cities of the Heart” maintain a similar balance of majesty and menace, as does the uneasy “Those Were the Days,” co-written by Baker and jazz pianist Mike Taylor.\n\nElsewhere on Wheels of Fire, Clapton's blues muse rages eloquently on riveting readings of Howlin' Wolf's “Sitting on Top of the World” and Albert King's “Born Under A Bad Sign,” which find the guitarist summoning up vocal fireworks to match his instrumental ferocity. Clapton's blues improvisations were also prominent on Wheels of Fire's live LP, recorded is March 1968 at San Francisco's Fillmore and Winterland venues. While the four-and-a-half-minute, Clapton-led live version of Robert Johnson's “Crossroads” is a masterpiece of concise, focused intensity, a brooding 16-and-a-half-minute version of Willie Dickson's “Spoonful” demonstrates how effectively Cream applied the principles of jazz improvisation to the rock idiom. Cream exercises its most bombastic tendencies on Baker's “Toad,” which stretches the modest Fresh Cream number into a 16-minute jam.\n\nAlso recorded during the Wheels of Fire sessions was “Anyone for Tennis,” a gentle Clapton/Sharp composition that showcases Cream's whimsical side. With a bemused Clapton vocal and a spare, largely acoustic arrangement, the song was originally released as a single prior to Wheels of Fire, and also served, somewhat incongruously, as the main title theme of director Richard Rush's bikers-vs.-Native-Americans b-movie The Savage Seven.\n\nWheels of Fire, topped the U.S. Album charts, sealing Cream's status as one of world's best-selling recording acts and top-drawing concert attractions. So the Band's announcement, shortly after the album's release, of its decision to disband shocked fans and mystified the music industry.\n\nCream bid adieu to its public with a late-1968 farewell tour, followed by the January 1969 release of the Goodbye album, which again combined studio and live recordings. The latter was highlighted by a fierce nine-and-a-half-minute workout of “I'm So Glad,” which finds Clapton alternating between tasteful picking and explosive chording, over Bruce and Baker's chugging runaway-train bottom.\n\nOf Goodbye's three studio tracks, “Badge” – which Clapton co-wrote with George Harrison, who also plays rhythm guitar under the pseudonym “L'Angelo Misterioso” – demonstrates a sublime melodic sensibility and features a confident, charismatic Clapton vocal. Bruce and Brown's jaunty, piano-driven “Doing That Scrappy Thing” catches Cream in a light-hearted mood, while Baker's giddy “What A Bringdown” closes the band's recording career on an appropriately kaleidoscopic note.\n\nThe same batch of San Francisco recordings that yielded Wheels of Fire's concert sides were tapped for a pair of live albums issued after the band's breakup. Live Cream, released in April 1970, consisted largely of songs from Fresh Cream, including a thunderous ten-minute take of Bruce's “N.S.U.” and muscular renditions of Muddy Water's “Rollin' and Tumblin'” and the languid Bruce/Godfrey blues “Sleepy Time Time.”\n\nLive Cream, Volume 2 followed in March 1972, combining more Winterland tracks with tracks cut at the Oakland Coliseum during the farewell tour. Concentrating on versions of some of Cream's better-known standards, the album's highlights included a triumphant seven-and-a-half-minute “Sunshine of Your Love.”\n\nIn hindsight, Cream's relatively brief lifespan isn't surprising, considering the three musician's wide-ranging talents and ambitions. In the decades since, Clapton, Baker and Bruce have gone on to pursue divergent yet rewarding musical paths. So the announcement of a 2005 Cream reunion-a prospect that had long been considered to be the stuff of unattainable fan fantasy-came as an even bigger surprise than the band's original decision to break up while still at the top of their game. But regardless of what transpires in Cream's second lease on life, the band's place in the rock pantheon was assured long ago, and the evidence is right here. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cream/Gold\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "After a mere three albums in just under three years, Cream called it quits in 1969.\nBeing proper gentlemen, they said their formal goodbyes with a tour and a farewell album called -- what else? -- Goodbye.\nAs a slim, six-song single LP, it's far shorter than the rambling, out-of-control Wheels of Fire, but it boasts the same structure, evenly dividing its time between tracks cut on-stage and in the studio. While the live side contains nothing as indelible as \"Crossroads,\" the live music on the whole is better than that on Wheels of Fire, capturing the trio at an empathetic peak as a band.\nIt's hard, heavy rock, with Cream digging deep into their original \"Politician\" with the same intensity as they do on \"Sitting on Top of the World,\" but it's the rampaging \"I'm So Glad\" that illustrates how far they've come; compare it to the original studio version on Fresh Cream and it's easy to see just how much further they're stretching their improvisation. The studio side also finds them at something of a peak. Boasting a song apiece from each member, it opens with the majestic classic \"Badge,\" co-written by Eric Clapton and George Harrison and ranking among both of their best work. It's followed by Jack Bruce's \"Doing That Scrapyard Thing,\" an overstuffed near-masterpiece filled with wonderful, imaginative eccentricities, and finally, there's Ginger Baker's tense, dramatic \"What a Bringdown,\" easily the best original he contributed to the group.\nLike all of Cream's albums outside Disraeli Gears, Goodbye is an album of moments, not a tight cohesive work, but those moments are all quite strong on their own terms, making this a good and appropriate final bow.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cream/Goodbye\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This album contains six tracks recorded at various performances from 9 March to 4 October 1968.\n\nMatthew Greenwald of AllMusic stated that Volume 2 had more songs on it than its predecessor, including two songs whose album versions were released as singles. He also commented on how the sound quality was some of the best at the time. He did not like, however, that there were not as many extended jams as there were on the predecessor and that Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton's singing is not good on \"White Room\" and \"Sunshine of Your Love.\" Greenwald felt that the live version of \"Deserted Cities of the Heart\" is better than the studio version.\n\nPersonell:\n    Eric Clapton – vocals, guitar\n    Jack Bruce – vocals, bass, harmonica\n    Ginger Baker – drums\n    Felix Pappalardi – producer\n    Tom Dowd – recording engineer\n    Bill Halverson – recording engineer\n    Gene Paul – re-mix engineer\n    Kevin Brady – re-mix engineer\n    Jim Marshall – cover photography\n    Gene Trindl – backliner photography\n    Stanisław Zagórski – album design <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Cream/Live+Cream+Volume+II\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Sunshine of Your Love\" is a song by the British supergroup Cream, released on the Disraeli Gears album. It was Cream's best-selling song and Atlantic Records' best-selling to date as well. It features a distinctive guitar/bass guitar riff and an acclaimed guitar solo from Eric Clapton. It was written by bassist Jack Bruce, Pete Brown, and Clapton. In 2004, the song was named the 65th greatest song of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. In 2009 it was named the 44th best hard rock song of all time by VH1.\n\nDevelopment of the song began in January 1967 when Bruce and Clapton attended a Jimi Hendrix show at the Saville Theatre in London. Inspired by the likes of Richard Wetherell and rock drummer, Bruce returned home and wrote the now memorable guitar riff that runs throughout the song. The lyrics to \"Sunshine of Your Love\" were written during an all-night creative session between Bruce and Brown, a poet who worked with the band: \"I picked up my double bass and played the riff. Pete looked out the window and the sun was coming up. He wrote 'It's getting near dawn and lights close their tired eyes…'\" Clapton later wrote the chorus (\"I've been waiting so long…\") which also yielded the song's title.\n\nClapton's guitar tone on the song is created using his 1964 Gibson SG guitar and a Marshall amplifier. It is also believed that a Vox Clyde McCoy Picture Wah is placed fully in the bass position for the solo section. The song is renowned among guitarists as perhaps the best example of his legendary late-'60s \"woman tone\", a thick yet articulate sound that many have tried to emulate. For the solo Clapton quoted the opening lines from the pop standard \"Blue Moon,\" creating a contrast between the sun and the moon.\n\nDrummer Ginger Baker's distinctive drum part was suggested by producer Tom Dowd, who drew his inspiration from what he called the \"Indian beat\" of classic Western films. This slow, downbeat-stressing beat forms a key element of the song. Unlike most standard rock beats which have a bass drum on 1 and 3 with a snare on 2 and 4, the beat in \"Sunshine\" is played almost exclusively on tom-toms, emphasizing beats 1 and 3. At the end of the song the rhythm is dramatically increased, with Baker (as well as the other two) abandoning the song's progression and simply jamming over an open A chord. However, Baker claims that he was the one who came up with the drum pattern and didn't receive writing credit: \"not even a thank you!\"\n\nThe band's publisher, Atlantic Records, initially rejected the song. Booker T. Jones, leader of Booker T. and the MG's and a respected Atlantic musician, heard the band rehearsing the song in the Atlantic studios and recommended it to the record company bosses. Based on this recommendation, Atlantic approved the recording.\n\n\"Sunshine of Your Love\" was the band's first big US hit. In the US, this first charted in February, 1968 at #36. With the release of the album in August, it re-entered the chart and went to #5. The song appears on the soundtracks of the movies School of Rock, Goodfellas, Uncommon Valor, and True Lies. The opening riff also appeared at the end of a Futurama episode and in an episode of The Simpsons, it is played when Mona Simpson sees Joe Namath's long hair.\n\nThe song's distinctive riff is based on a D blues scale (pentatonic).\n\nIn March 2005, Q magazine placed \"Sunshine of Your Love\" at number 19 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream/_/Sunshine+of+Your+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Finally, \"White Room\" is notable for showcasing guitarist Eric Clapton's best known use of the Vox Clyde McCoy Picture Wah (a device used to turn off bass and treble as the pedal is rocked) in the bridge and extended solo.\n\nAlong with \"Sunshine of Your Love\" and \"Crossroads\", White Room is one of Cream's most notable songs, reaching number 6 on the U.S. pop charts. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream/_/White+Room\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Arranged by guitarist Eric Clapton, the Cream version had a faster tempo than the original, and included two lines borrowed from Johnson's \"Traveling Riverside Blues.\"\n\nUnlike Cream's usual arrangement with bassist Jack Bruce singing, guitarist Eric Clapton took the vocals on this recording. Clapton's explosive guitar solos cemented his reputation as a guitar legend; his work from the track was named by one critic the greatest live rock solo ever. Bruce's fluid bass playing, blurring the line between rhythm and melody, has been similarly honored as the second-best live bass performance.\n\nIt was placed at #409 on the 2004 List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and #3 on the 2008 RS Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time lists. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream/_/Crossroads\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The chorus of  this laconic paean in praise of Wolf's soul satisfying lover ironically became associated with the launching pad of  an i.v. drug user's tool kit; the spoon.  Interestingly this dynamic, where the chorus of a song overwhelms the composition's textual intent, is very often in evidence: especially in pop music.  Another famous example would be  The Police's  hit song  \"Roxanne\".  The story line in this song is a  plea to Roxanne,  that she does not have to be a lady in red; she doesn't  \"have to put on\" that light.  The deliciously repetitive and famous line seems to be urging the exact opposite; put it on, with the assumed result that Roxanne will take it off; and for who?\n\nEric Clapton would fall, or had already fallen into the one way cul-de-sac which romanticized the hard drug \"spoonful\" as did I and thousands of hipsters of our generation.  Thankfully, after a seeming infinity of wheel spinning, many emerged.  Clapton's musical contributions are legendary.  We  can only speculate regarding the effect that the \"spoonful\" may have had upon his musical genius and his legacy.   <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream/_/Spoonful\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"I'm So Glad\" is a song originally recorded by Skip James in the early 1930s. The song is derived from a 1927 song by Art Sizemore and George A. Little entitled \"So Tired\". It was then covered by Cream on their first album, Fresh Cream, then later put on their last studio album Goodbye as a live performance.\n\"I'm So Glad\" was also recorded by Deep Purple, in a medley with their original song \"Prelude to Happiness\", for their 1968 debut album Shades of Deep Purple. Deep Purple supported Cream on their Farewell Tour in October 1968 where Cream's Goodbye version was recorded, and recorded their own live album, entitled Inglewood - Live in California on the same night. The album, remained shelved until 2002, when it finally was released. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cream/_/I%27m+So+Glad\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Communion is the debut studio album by English synth-pop trio Years & Years. It was released on 10 July 2015 through Polydor Records for the United Kingdom and other countries and Interscope Records for the United States only.\n\n\"Real\" was released as the album's first single on 17 February 2014. Alexander said that some of the lyrics in \"Real\" were inspired by experiences he had with a former boyfriend: \"When I met him, I was really wasted and I fell off a bin and had to go A&E because I sprained my wrist, so I put in the line, 'Broke my bones playing games with you'. And then I got this rash… That's where the line, 'I itch all night, I itch for you' comes from.\"\n\n\"Take Shelter\" was released as the album's second single on 18 August 2014 and peaked at number 140 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"Desire\" was released on 23 November 2014 as the album's third single and peaked at number 22 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"King\" was released as the album's fourth single on 27 February 2015. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, with a combined sales-streaming figure of 101,000 copies, and reached number three on the Irish Singles Chart. Alexander has stated many times that the hit song has a much darker meaning “I was going out with a guy that was kind of a douche bag, but I still really liked him,” explains Olly. “I know lots of people can related to this. It’s a song about how it feels good to be treated badly by someone.”\n\n\"Shine\" was released as the album's fifth single on 5 July 2015 and debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"Eyes Shut\" was released as the album's sixth single on 13 November 2015. A slower song Alexander has stated that he wrote the song when he was going through a period of depression. Alexander has frequently spoken about his Mental Health, particularly that he struggles with depression, anxiety and when he was younger an eating disorder and self harm. He's confirmed he sees a private therapist and takes medication.\n\nThe album has received positive reviews. Communion received a score of 68 on Metacritic based on 18 professional reviews. In an enthusiastic review, AllMusic rated the album 4 out of 5 stars, highlighting the group's ability to skillfully bridge the \"ambient '80s style synth-pop of M83 with the funky dancefloor grooves of Justin Timberlake\" and transform their influences into something new. In another 4 out of 5 review, DIY praised singer Olly Alexander for managing to avoid cliché while tackling well-tread subjects such as heartbreak and loneliness, and remarks that the group adds a human touch to powerful pop anthems. Pitchfork, which rated the album a 7.4 out of 10, addressed potential critiques by remarking that while much of the album may seem familiar, Years & Years distills rather than dilutes the formula of \"reimagined '80s and '90s club pop\".\nMultiple reviews, however, commented on the derivativeness of the songs with The Independent calling the album a \"slick amalgamation of 2014's sounds\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that the group doesn't \"seem to have an original idea in their collective heads\", but still acknowledged that the album's \"watertight\" pop songwriting made it enjoyable. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times made a similar critique of the album, to which he referred as \"diet-club music\", but again praised the songwriting as excellent and effective. In an overall positive review, Billboard noted that the group has a \"skill set, not a sound\", particularly pointing out the album's strong melodies, emotional honesty and broad tastes. In mixed reviews, NME rated the album 2 out of 5 lamenting that the album had little to say and took no risks, while Drowned in Sound gave the album a 5 out of 10, writing that while many elements of the album were pleasant, overall it did not command listeners' attention.\n\nCommunion debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, outselling the rest of the top five combined in its first week of release. In the United States, the album debuted at number 47 selling 8,841 copies in its first week.\nCommunion sold over one million copies worldwide and became the fastest-selling debut in 2015 from a UK-signed band. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Olly+Alexander+(Years+&+Years)/Communion+(Deluxe)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Yams founded the Mob with A$AP Bari and A$AP Illz in 2006, managed its label, A$AP Worldwide, and handled A&R and executive production.\n\nIn January 2015, Yams passed away at the age of 26. The death was ruled an accidental mixed-drug overdose—the coroner found opiates and Xanax in Yams’ system.\n\nRocky told the New York Times: “Yams always had a struggle with drugs. That was his thing.” The summer before he died, Rocky and the Mob put Yams in rehab—but he didn’t stay sober for long.\n\nA year after Yams’ death, on what the A$AP mob has dubbed “Yams Day,” the crew unites to pay their respects to their beloved friend for how much he inspired them.\n\nRocky told MTV:\n\nI lost my brother. I’d trade all this music to have Yams back…Life ain’t good without Yams. He was a visionary. He always had faith in me, even when no one knew what was gonna happen next.\n\nOn July 21, The A$AP Mob made its network television debut on The Late Show with Jimmy Fallon, performing the song live.\n\nSource: Genius Lyrics <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/A$AP+Mob/Yamborghini+High\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The cover of the project even features a photo of Yams as a baby, given to the group by Yams' mom. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/A$AP+Mob/Cozy+Tapes,+Vol.+1:+Friends\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "A$AP Rocky of Harlem teams up with Quavo and Playboi Carti of Atlanta, Philadelphia’s Lil Uzi Vert, and LA-based Frank Ocean to deliver this one-of-a-kind banger. With a stacked list of artists, including four of the east coast’s hottest hip-hop talents, “RAF” brings unique verses highlighting each artist’s flair and character.\n\nThe hit was premiered on the May 15th on the 6th episode of Frank Ocean’s “blonded RADIO”, and a week later the official song was released on Apple Music on May 22.\n\nThe official updated single/album version includes both Frank’s verse from this single version, as well as the verse from “RAF Version 2”.\n\nThis song premiered on Frank’s Blonded Radio along with its alternative version. Rocky also appeared on the remix to Frank’s “Chanel” which premiered on an earlier episode.\n\nI remember doing the “Raf” verses, and at the time I was practicing rap, practicing structuring verses, practicing flow, trying to get better at doing it. I was writing a lot of verses. Rocky [and the A$AP Mob] were making Cozy Tapes, the second one, and Rocky told me he had this song called “Raf,” and I thought that was funny. I was living in a hotel then, and I had a studio setup somewhere else on the property. So I jump in the studio and I’m putting the verse down, just quick, you know, sorted it out, went by Rocky’s house and played him the song. I could tell he was very animated about it, and then he said, “Man, you rappin’ like it’s 2003.” And I was just like, “Oh, shit!” I understood why he was saying it, because the flow was more complicated. I thought, All right, we want the bouncy today thing. Let me riff on that idea. And so I wrote that verse, and I sent it to him. And I told him, “Tell me, what year are we now?”\n\n– Frank Ocean, W Magazine\n\nIt was certified platinum by the RIAA on October 16, 2020. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/A$AP+Mob/_/Raf+(feat.+A$AP+Rocky,+Playboi+Carti,+Quavo,+Lil+Uzi+Vert+&+Frank+Ocean)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "The Zombies are an English rock band formed in 1962 in St Albans and led by keyboardist and vocalist Rod Argent and vocalist Colin Blunstone.\n\nThe group scored British and American hits in 1964 with \"She's Not There\". In the US, two further singles—\"Tell Her No\" in 1965 and \"Time of the Season\" in 1968—were also successful. Their 1968 album Odessey and Oracle is ranked number 100 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The Zombies were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nThe Zombies signed to Decca and recorded their first hit, \"She's Not There\" after winning a beat-group competition sponsored by the London Evening News. \"She's Not There\" was released in mid-1964 and peaked at number twelve in the U.K., where it would be their only top-forty hit. It was first aired in the United States in early August 1964, on New York City rock station WINS by Stan Z. Burns, who debuted the song on his daily noontime \"Hot Spot\" segment during which new songs were played. The tune began to catch on in early Autumn and eventually climbed to number two.\n\nIn early 1965, \"Tell Her No\" became another big seller in the United States but had failed to make the Top 40 in the band's native U.K Subsequent recordings such as \"I Love You\" (which became a hit for People! in 1968), \"Indication\", \"Whenever You're Ready\", and \"Is This the Dream\" failed to achieve the success of the previous two singles.\n\nTheir first LP, Begin Here (1965), was a collection of early singles, half a dozen original songs combined with several R&B covers. The Zombies signed to CBS Records for one final LP in 1967. The resulting album, Odessey and Oracle, was one of the very first to utilise a Mellotron keyboard, as the band's budget did not allow for the hiring of session musicians. The band discovered too late that \"odyssey\" had been misspelled by the cover designers and were reportedly deeply embarrassed.\n\nBy the time Odessey and Oracle was released in April 1968, the band had broken up. The album sold little, and was only released in the U.S. because musician Al Kooper vouched for it.  It has since gone on to be recognized as one of the greatest albums of all time, with Rolling Stone ranking it eightieth on its 500 Greatest Albums list.  An album track called \"Time of the Season\" was released as a single. and eventually (1969) it became a huge nationwide hit (Billboard  number three) after a radio DJ discovered it and put it on heavy rotation.\n\nAfter The Zombies disbanded, Rod Argent formed a band called Argent; Colin Blunstone started a solo career. In1991 Blunstone, Grundy, and White briefly reunited as The Zombies with guitarist Sebastian Santa Maria, and recorded the album New World.\n\n \nIconic British psychedelic pop legends The Zombies have returned to celebrate the release of their latest Billboard-charting album, Still Got That Hunger, lead by founding and current members, vocalist Colin Blunstone and keyboardist Rod Argent, alongside bassist Jim Rodford (formerly of ARGENT and The Kinks), Rodford’s son Steve Rodford on drums, and renowned session guitarist Tom Toomey.\n \nThe band’s live performances, described by Rolling Stone as “absolutely triumphant”, take fans on a journey through time, from their early hits…their 1968 masterpiece Odessey & Oracle…post-Zombies solo favorites…right to today with Still Got That Hunger.\n \nThe second U.K. band following the Beatles to score a #1 hit in America, The Zombies infiltrated the airwaves with the sophisticated melodies, breathy vocals, choral back-up harmonies and jazzy keyboard riffs of their 1960’s hit singles “She’s Not There” and “Tell Her No.” Ironically, the group broke-up just prior to achieving their greatest success – the worldwide chart-topping single “Time of the Season,” from their swan-song album  Odessey & Oracle, ranked #100 in Rolling Stone’s ‘500 Greatest Albums of All Time.’  To this day, generations of new bands have cited The Zombies’ work as pop touchstones, and the band continues to be embraced by new generations of fans.\n \nFollowing the break-up of the original band, lead vocalist Colin Blunstone went on to develop an acclaimed solo career (with hits including \"Say You Don't Mind,\" \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\", and “Old & Wise” with Alan Parsons Project) and keyboardist/songwriter Rod Argent rocked ‘70’s arenas with his eponymous band ARGENT (“Hold Your Head Up,” “God Gave Rock ‘n’ Roll To You”), but the legend of The Zombies continued to take on a life of its own.  By the start of the new Millennium, Blunstone and Argent were inspired to resurrect The Zombies.\n \nThe explosive release of Still Got That Hunger proved that Zombies fever is stronger than ever, with premieres at Rolling Stone, Mojo, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian  Speakeasy, and Spin, alongside special broadcast performances, including Later…With Jools Holland, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert and AOL Sessions. Moreover, it marked a historical moment on the Billboard charts, as The Zombies’ critically acclaimed album Odessey And Oracle re-entered the Billboard 100 forty-eight years later at the same time as Still Got That Hunger!   \n \nThe Zombies look forward to an even busier 2017, with a major world tour, table-top book release and other exciting projects to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the recording of Odessey And Oracle.    <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Zombies\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It reached number twelve in the UK Singles Chart in August 1964., number two in the Billboard Hot 100 (USA), and #2 in Canada.\n\nRolling Stone magazine ranked \"She's Not There\" #291 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nOne of the song's most distinctive features is Argent's electric piano sound which was rare at the time. In the UK, it was the first hit song with an electric piano as the lead instrument. Rod Argent, the keyboard player in the Zombies, was challenged by Decca Records producer Ken Jones to write a hit record for his group, and he came up with this.\n\nSantana covered this on their 1977 album Moonflower. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Zombies/_/She%27s+Not+There\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Time of the Season\" is a song by The Zombies, featured on their 1968 album Odessey and Oracle. It was written by keyboard player Rod Argent and recorded at Abbey Road Studios in August 1967.\n\n \n\nSeveral other songs from Odessey and Oracle were released as singles prior to \"Time of the Season\". Columbia Records supported the album and its singles at the urging of new A&R Rep, Al Kooper. One of the singles Kooper pushed for was the quite uncommercial sounding \"Butcher's Tale\", which he and Columbia thought might catch on as an anti-war statement, at the time a popular trend. \"Time of the Season\" was only released at Kooper's urging, after previous singles flopped, and made its breakthrough in early 1969, over a year after the band split up, reaching #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 in Canada. It did not chart in the band's native Britain.\n\nThe song's characteristics include the unique voice of lead singer Colin Blunstone, the memorable bass riff (which is similar to Ben E. King's hit \"Stand By Me\"), and Rod Argent's fast-paced psychedelic improvisation. The lyrics are an archetypical depiction of the emotions surrounding the Summer of Love. It is famous for such call-and-response verses as \"What's your name? (What's your name?)  / Who's your daddy? (Who's your daddy?) / (He rich?) Is he rich like me?\" (approximately fifty seconds into the track). Both stereo and monaural original releases contain vocal responses.\n\nIn 1998, Big Beat Records released a CD reissue of Odessey and Oracle containing both the original stereo and mono versions of \"Time of The Season\". It also featured a newly remixed alternate version containing instrumental backing underneath the vocals during the entire chorus. These instruments were mixed out one of part on the original 1968 stereo and mono versions to create an a cappella vocal section.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Zombies/_/Time+of+the+Season\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "name": "Ray Charles",
        "bio": "Ray Charles (Ray Charles Robinson,  Albany, Georgia, September 23, 1930 - Beverly Hills, California, June 10, 2004), was an American singer-songwriter, musician, arranger, and band leader. \n\nAs a rock and roll, rhythm & blues, soul, blues, jazz, country and pop musician he helped to shape the sound of rhythm & blues.\n\nHe brought a soulful sound to everything from country music (\"I Can't Stop Loving You\") to rock and roll (\"Mess Around\"), to pop standards to a now-iconic rendition of \"America the Beautiful.\" Frank Sinatra called him \"the only genius in the business.\"\n\nRay Charles was born in Albany, Georgia on September 23, 1930. He was the son of Aretha Williams, a share cropper, and Bailey Robinson, a railroad repair man, mechanic and handyman. The two were never married. The family moved to Greenville, Florida, when Ray was an infant. Bailey had three more families, leaving Aretha to raise the family on her own.\n\nRay Charles was not born blind. He started to lose his sight somewhere at the age of five. He was rendered totally blind by the age of seven. Charles never knew exactly why he lost his sight, though there are sources that suggest his blindness was due to glaucoma, and some other sources suggest that Ray began to lose his sight from an infection caused by soapy water to his eyes which was left untreated. He attended school at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine, Florida from 1937-1945 where he developed his musical gift that he is known and remembered for today. His father died when he was ten, followed by his mother five years later.\n\nIn school, he was taught only classical music, but he wanted to play what he heard on the radio, jazz and blues. After his mother died, Charles did not return to school. He lived in Jacksonville with a couple who were friends of his mother. For over a year, he played the piano for bands at the Ritz Theatre in LaVilla, earning $4 a night. Charles moved to Orlando, then Tampa, where he played \"with a hillbilly band called The Florida Playboys.\" This is where Charles began his reputation of always wearing sunglasses that were made by designer Billy Stickles.\n\nCharles had always played for other people, but he wanted a band that was his own. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, but Chicago and New York City were too big. He moved to Seattle in 1947 and soon started recording, first for the label Swing Time Records, achieving his first hit with the 1949 \"Confession Blues\". The song soared to #2 on the R&B charts. He followed his first recording with his only other hit with Swingtime, \"Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand\" in 1951. It hit #5 on the R&B charts. He then signed with Ahmet Ertegün at Atlantic Records a year later. When he entered show business, his name was shortened to Ray Charles to avoid confusion with boxer Sugar Ray Robinson.\n\nBreakthrough period with Atlantic Records\nAlmost immediately after signing with Atlantic, Charles scored his first hit singles with the label with \"It Should Have Been Me\" and the Ertegün-composed \"Mess Around\", both making the charts in 1953. But it was Charles' \"I Got A Woman\" (composed with band mate Renald Richard) that brought the musician to national prominence.\n\nThe song reached the top of Billboard's R&B singles chart in 1955 and from there until 1959, Charles would have a series of R&B chart-toppers including \"This Little Girl of Mine\", \"Lonely Avenue\", \"Mary Ann\", \"Drown in My Own Tears\" and \"The Night Time (Is the Right Time)\", which were compiled on his Atlantic releases Hallelujah, I Love Her So, Yes Indeed!, and The Genius Sings the Blues. Charles was often cited for using his voice like a saxophone, most notably by the prominent critic Victor Bollo. During this time of transition, he recruited a young girl group from Philadelphia named The Cookies as his background singing group, recording with them in New York and changing their name to the Raelettes in the process.\n\nCrossover success\nIn 1959, Charles crossed over to top 40 radio with the release of his impromptu blues number, \"What'd I Say\", which was initially conceived while Charles was in concert. The song would reach number 1 on the R&B list and would become Charles' first top ten single on the pop charts, peaking at number 6. Charles would also record The Genius of Ray Charles, before leaving Atlantic for a more lucrative deal with ABC Records in 1959.\n\nHit songs such as \"Georgia On My Mind\" (US #1), \"Hit the Road Jack\" (US #1) and \"Unchain My Heart\" (US #9) helped him transition to pop success and his landmark 1962 album, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music and its sequel Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2, helped to bring country into the mainstream of music. He also had major pop hits in 1963 with \"Busted\" (US #4) and \"Take These Chains From My Heart\" (US #8), and also scoring a Top 20 hit four years later, in 1967, with \"Here We Go Again\" (US #15) (which would later be duetted with Norah Jones in 2004).\n\nLater years\nIn 1965, Charles was arrested for possession of heroin, a drug to which he had been addicted for nearly 20 years. It was his third arrest for the offence, but he avoided jail time after kicking the habit in a clinic in Los Angeles. He spent a year on parole in 1966, when his single \"Crying Time\" reached #6 on the charts.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and into the 1970s, Charles' releases were hit-or-miss, with some big hits and critically acclaimed work. His version of \"Georgia On My Mind\" was proclaimed the state song of Georgia on April 24, 1979, with Charles performing it on the floor of the state legislature. He also had success with his unique version of \"America the Beautiful.\"\n\nIn November 1977 Charles appeared as the host of NBC's Saturday Night Live. In the 1980s a number of other events increased Charles' recognition among young audiences. He made a cameo appearance in the popular 1980 film The Blues Brothers. In 1985, \"The Right Time\" was featured in the episode \"Happy Anniversary\" of The Cosby Show on NBC. The next year in 1986, he sang America The Beautiful at Wrestlemania 2. In a Pepsi Cola commercial of the early 1990s, Charles popularized the catchphrase \"You Got the Right One, Baby!\" plus he helped in the song \"We Are the World\" a touching song for USA for Africa.\n\nDespite his support of Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1960s and his support for the American Civil Rights Movement, Charles courted controversy when he toured South Africa in 1981, during an international boycott of the country because of its apartheid policy.\n\nCharles recorded a cover version of the Japanese band Southern All Stars' song \"Itoshi no Ellie\" as \"Ellie My Love\" for a Suntory TV advertisement, reaching #3 on Japan's Oricon chart. Eventually, it sold more than 400,000 copies, and became that year's best-selling single performed by a Western artist for the Japanese music market.\n\nBesides winning 17 Grammy Awards in his career (include five posthumous ones), Charles was also honored in many other ways. In 1979, he was one of the first honorees of the Georgia State Music Hall of Fame being recognized for being a musician born in the state. Ray's version of \"Georgia On My Mind\" was made into the official state song for Georgia. In 1981, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was one of the first inductees to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural ceremony in 1986.

In 1985, he performed for Ronald Reagan's second inauguration, and in 1993 performed for Bill Clinton's first inauguration.\n\nIn the late '80s and early '90s, Charles made appearances on The Super Dave Osbourne Show, where he performed and appeared in a few vignettes where he was somehow driving a car, often as Super Dave's chauffeur. At the height of his newfound fame in the early nineties, Charles did guest vocals for quite a few projects. He also appeared (with Chaka Khan) on long time friend Quincy Jones' hit \"I'll Be Good to You\" in 1990, from Jones' album Back on the Block.\n\nFollowing Jim Henson's death in 1990, Ray Charles appeared in the one-hour CBS tribute, The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson. He gave a short speech about the deceased, stating that Henson \"took a simple song and a piece of felt and turned it into a moment of great power\". Charles was referring to the song \"It's Not Easy Being Green\", which Charles later performed with the rest of the Muppet cast in a tribute to Henson's legacy.\n\nDuring the sixth season of Designing Women, Ray Charles vocally performed \"Georgia On My Mind\", rather than the song being rendered by other musicians without lyrics as in the previous five seasons\n\nDuring his life he received eight honorary doctorates, the last from Dillard University in New Orleans in 2003. Later that same year, he performed his 10,000th career concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nCharles finalized \"Genius Loves Company\" a duets album in 2004, which posthumously became the best selling album of his career.

He also received the NAACP Image Awards' \"Hall of Fame Award.\"\n\nCharles died in July 2004 in California. Three months later, his biopic \"Ray\" opened in theaters. The performance of Jamie Foxx as Ray gave him an Oscar for best lead performance in a feature film.\n\nRecently, a series of slot machines were designed in Charles' name for the visually handicapped and the legendary performer was also named a \"living legend\" by the Library of Congress.\n\nCharles once told an interviewer from USA Today, \"Music to me is just like breathing. I have to have it. It's part of me.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Ray Charles’ initial foray into standards is a career highlight. For the first half, Charles’ old friend Quincy Jones crafts hard-swinging big band arrangements that match Ray’s band made up of musicians from the Ellington and Basie camps. Ralph Burns arranges the jazz-meets-string-orchestra second half, which features “Just for a Thrill” and “Come Rain or Come Shine.”\n\nThe album showcased Charles’ breakout from rhythm and blues and onto a broader musical stage. Atlantic Records gave him full support in production and arrangements. As originally presented, the A side of the album featured the Ray Charles band with David “Fathead” Newman supplemented by players from the Count Basie and Duke Ellington bands, and arrangements by Quincy Jones.\n\nThe B side of the original album consists of six ballads with arrangements by Ralph Burns and a large string orchestra. Charles’s performance of “Come Rain or Come Shine”, a song identified with Frank Sinatra, brought public attention to his voice alone without the “distractions” of his soulful piano and his snappy band.\n\nEach side contains a tribute to Louis Jordan with two songs he had hits with “Let the Good Times Roll” and (“Don’t Let the Sun Catch You Crying”).\n\nReview by Scott Yanow of allmusic:\nSome players from Ray Charles’ big band are joined by many ringers from the Count Basie and Duke Ellington bands for the first half of this program, featuring Charles belting out six songs arranged by Quincy Jones. “Let the Good Times Roll” and “Deed I Do” are highlights, and there are solos by tenorman David “Fathead” Newman, trumpeter Marcus Belgrave, and (on “Two Years of Torture”) tenor Paul Gonsalves. The remaining six numbers are ballads, with Charles backed by a string orchestra arranged by Ralph Burns (including “Come Rain or Come Shine” and “Don’t Let the Sun Catch You Cryin’”). Charles’ voice is heard throughout in peak form, giving soul to even the veteran standards.\n\nReview in Rolling Stone:\nCharles spent the Fifties working hard to pioneer his own sound, fusing jazz, gospel and the blues into a new soul style that changed American music. But here he relaxes: Genius is easy – swinging pop, featuring big-band accompaniment. When he sings “Am I Blue?” the only answer is “Hell, yeah!”\n\nLP Track Listing\n\nSide One\n1. “Let the Good Times Roll” (Sam Theard, Fleecie Moore) – 2:49\n2. “It Had to Be You” (Gus Kahn, Isham Jones) – 2:41\n3. “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” (Irving Berlin) – 2:50\n4. “Two Years of Torture” (Percy Mayfield, Charles Joseph Morris) – 3:22\n5. “When Your Lover Has Gone” (Einar Aaron Swan) – 2:47\n6. “‘Deed I Do” (Walter Hirsch, Fred Rose) – 2:23\n\nSide Two\n7. “Just for a Thrill” (Lil Hardin Armstrong, Don Raye) – 3:21\n8. “You Won’t Let Me Go” (Bud Allen, Buddy Johnson) – 3:16\n9. “Tell Me You’ll Wait for Me” (Charles Brown, Oscar Moore) – 3:21\n10. “Don’t Let the Sun Catch You Cryin’” (Joe Greene) – 3:42\n11. “Am I Blue?” (Grant Clarke, Harry Akst) – 3:35\n12. “Come Rain or Come Shine” (Johnny Mercer, Harold Arlen) – 3:40\n\nPersonnel\n* Ray Charles – piano, vocals\n* Clark Terry – trumpet\n* Ernie Royal – trumpet\n* Joe Newman – trumpet\n* Snookie Young – trumpet\n* Marcus Belgrave – trumpet\n* John Hunt – trumpet\n* Melba Liston – trombone\n* Quentin Jackson – trombone\n* Thomas Mitchell – trombone\n* Al Gray – trombone\n* Frank Wess – flute, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone\n* Marshall Royal – alto sax\n* Paul Gonsalves – tenor sax (and solo on “Two Years of Torture”)\n* Zoot Sims – tenor sax (on “Let the Good Times Roll”, “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” and “‘Deed I Do”)\n* Billy Mitchell – tenor sax (on “It had to be You”, “Two Years of Torture” and “When Your Lover Has Gone”)\n* David “Fathead” Newman – tenor sax (and solos on “Let the Good Times Roll”, “When Your Lover Has Gone”, “‘Deed I Do”)\n* Quincy Jones – arranger, conductor\n* Allen Hanlon – guitar\n* Wendell Marshall – bass\n* Ted Sommer – drums\n* Bob Brookmeyer – valve trombone\n* Harry Lookofsky – concertmaster\n* Unidentified – large woodwinds and strings section\n* Ralph Burns – arranger\n\nReleased: 2009 (originally released in 1959)\nRecorded: 1959\nGenre: R&B\nLength: 37:47\nLabel: Atlantic/Rhino - Rhino R1 1312 (2009)\nProducers: Nesuhi Ertegun, Jerry Wexler\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/The+Genius+of+Ray+Charles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is a studio album by American R&B singer-songwriter and musician Ray Charles. It was recorded by Charles in February 1962 at Capitol Studios in New York City and at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, then released in April of that year by ABC-Paramount Records. The album departed stylistically from the singer's previous rhythm and blues music. It featured country, folk, and Western music standards reworked by Charles in popular song forms of the time, including R&B, pop, and jazz.\n\nAs his fifth LP release for ABC-Paramount, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music became a rapid critical and commercial success as it brought Ray Charles further mainstream notice, following his tenure for Atlantic Records. With the help of the album's four charting singles, Charles earned recognition in the pop market, as well as airplay on both R&B and country radio stations. Modern Sounds and its lead single, \"I Can't Stop Loving You\", were both certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1962, as each record had shipped 500,000 copies in the United States.\n\nRegarded by many critics as Charles's best studio album, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music has been considered by several music writers to be a landmark album in American music. The album's integration of soul and country music bent racial barriers in popular music, amid the height of the Civil Rights Movement. In the process of recording the album, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to exercise complete artistic control over his own recording career. The album has been called one of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/Modern+Sounds+in+Country+and+Western+Music\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Georgia on My Mind\" is a song written in 1930 by Hoagy Carmichael (music) and Stuart Gorrell (lyrics). It is the official state song of the U.S. state of Georgia. Gorrell wrote the lyrics for Hoagy's sister, Georgia Carmichael. However, the lyrics of the song are ambiguous enough to refer either to the state or to a woman named \"Georgia\". Carmichael's 1965 autobiography, Sometimes I Wonder, records the origin: a friend, saxophonist and bandleader Frankie Trumbauer, suggested: \"Why don't you write a song called 'Georgia?' Nobody lost much writing about the South.\" Thus, the song is universally believed to have been written about the state.\n\nIt was not until Ray Charles' 1960 recording on The Genius Hits the Road that the song became a major hit, reaching the number one spot for one week in November 1960 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. On March 7, 1979, in a mutual symbol of reconciliation after conflict over civil rights issues, he performed it before the Georgia General Assembly (the state legislature). After this performance, the connection to the state was firmly made, and then the Assembly adopted it as the state song on April 24.\ntag radio : Georgia On My Mind <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/_/Georgia+On+My+Mind\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It appears on virtually every Ray Charles best-of album and has been covered by artists such as Elvis Presley and the Beatles. A live version from the 1958 album \"Ray Charles At Newport\" is noted for its more cohesive and wilder band performance. Another live version recorded in 1964 was released on the 1965 \"Live In Concert\" album and as a single.\n\nChart Performance:\nThe song quickly climbed to number one R&B in January 1955 and was Ray Charles' first hit. It was later ranked No. 239 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. A re-recorded version in 1965 reached No. 79 on the Billboard pop chart. The 1954 recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nPersonnel:\nUnfortunately, specific personnel details for the recording session of \"I've Got a Woman\" were not available.\n\nCultural Impact:\nThe song has had a significant influence on popular music, sampled by artists like Kanye West in his song \"Gold Digger.\" It is a prototype of what later became termed as soul music.\n\nLinks:\nRay Charles Official Website: https://www.raycharles.com/\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/track/5yQ9Y4o6z1jAz8cE8pQXkw\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mrd14PxaUco\n\nSource:\nLast.fm Link: https://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/_/I%27ve+Got+a+Woman <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/_/I%27ve+Got+a+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After Charles' run of R&B hits, this song finally broke Charles into mainstream pop and the song itself sparked a new sub-genre of rhythm and blues titled soul, finally putting together all the elements that Charles had been creating since he recorded \"I Got a Woman\". It was ranked at #10 in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nAccording to Charles, while performing at a Milwaukee nightclub, he had performed the last song of his set, \"Night Time Is the Right Time\", when he was informed that there was another twelve minutes left in the show. Charles decided to fill the time by performing an impromptu version of the song that would eventually be recorded as What'd I Say. Charles told his backing band and female background singers, the Raelettes, to \"just follow me\". The song began on a Latin influenced drum beat and a Wurlitzer electric piano riff before Charles improvised his own lyrics to it.\n\nAs the band became more comfortable with the piece, Charles and the Raelettes started an impromptu call and response vocalization. Charles later said that the call and response section was \"all about the sounds of making love\".\n\nAlthough the song is usually listed as \"What'd I Say\", Charles always insisted that the name of the song is \"What I Say\" as heard on the track. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ray+Charles/_/What%27d+I+Say\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recognized for mixing many different genres of music together.\n\nIt was nominated by the Recording Academy, for Best engineered album, and producer Steve Lillywhite, who previously worked with U2, The Dave Matthews Band and The Rolling Stones, won for Producer of the Year, but not for his work on Mr. A–Z. The name of the album is a play on the artist's surname, \"Mraz\".\n\nAn opera solo performed by Mraz himself can be found on the track \"Mr. Curiosity\". In March 2010 this song charted in Germany after it had been performed by Lena Meyer-Landrut in the talent show contest Unser Star für Oslo (Our Star for Oslo), reaching a peak position of #44. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Mraz/Mr.+A-Z\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Only a handful of songs are written and slated but the momentum of love is with me. Every day new verses get added on. The songs are coming together piece by piece. The process is unlike any of the other records before this. It's like I'm being gifted the album without having to do the work. I'm creating that in 6 months the project will be complete and then we'll hit the road again with new sounds and new musicians.\"\n\nIn 2010 Mraz spent time in London, England, where he worked on songs for his new album with producer Martin Terefe and wrote with British singer-songwriter Dido. In August 2010, Mraz had a Q&A interview with Spin magazine. In the interview, he stated the current possible titles for his fourth album are Peace Canoe or The Love Album.\n\nOn December 8, 2011, Mraz told Jeff Benjamin of Billboard that the \"album is finished\" except for one track he was attempting to re-work as an acoustic version. He described the album as, \"It's not a departure in the sound of the genre in any way, it's just different tones, different textures. Musically, I think people are going to like it. It's personal. It's melodic. And it's mellow. There's a couple of up-tempo tunes, but mostly the rhythm of the heartbeat kind of takes precedence on this record. Medium-tempo tunes; which I love. It feels more like the pace of life. At least, based on my life and what I've been doing.\"\n\nOn January 20, 2012, during a performance streamed live from the Bing Bar at the Sundance Film Festival, Mraz told the audience that the album's title is Love Is a Four Letter Word.\n\n\n    \"The World As I See It\" was released as the first pre-release track on September 20, 2011. The pre-release version differs slightly from the album version, with the latter featuring an additional string part.\n\n    \"I Won't Give Up\" was released as the album's first official single on January 3, 2012. The song has peaked at number 8 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The song was initially presented as a lyric video around its January release, before another video was released in March 2012.\n\n    \"The Freedom Song\" (March 13), \"93 Million Miles\" (March 27) and \"Everything Is Sound\" (April 10) were each released as pre-release tracks in the run up to the albums release, with each song having a lyric video (in the same style as the original \"I Won't Give Up\" lyric video) on the official YouTube page. The pre-release versions of these songs are identical to the album tracks, and iTunes offered a \"complete your album option\" enabling purchasers to not have to pay any extra money for having purchased the pre-release tracks.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Mraz/Love+Is+a+Four+Letter+Word+(Deluxe+Edition)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

For fans who do not own \"Live at Java Joe's\"; the quintessential Jason Mraz album, this will suffice.  From the crowd participation (background vocals) in \"Did You Get my Message\" to the emotionally charged and gorgeous \"God Rest in Reason\" this album is a must own for the Mraz faithful.  If you have only heard the radio played Mraz, or the studio album Mraz, you have yet to truly experience the magic that is Jason Mraz.  He's a pro, the kind of pro that doesn't take himself too seriously, but has serious command of both his instruments: Voice and guitar. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Mraz/Selections+for+Friends\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"I'm Yours\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz, released in 2008 as the first single from his third studio album \"We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.\". The song was originally released on a limited edition EP called \"Extra Credit\" as a demo in 2005 to promote his second studio album \"Mr. A–Z\". It was performed in his 2004 and 2005 gigs and already became a crowd favorite before its release. \"I'm Yours\" was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 51st Grammy Awards.\n\n\"I'm Yours\" was a huge commercial success in the United States. The song peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100; and spent 76 weeks on the chart, breaking the record for the longest charting song on the chart, previously held by LeAnn Rimes' song \"How Do I Live\" with 69 weeks on the chart; this record has since been broken and is currently held by The Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\", which spent 90 weeks on the chart. As of January 2013, it is the tenth best-selling digital song of all time in the US, selling over 6 million downloads, and 12.2 million worldwide. In July 2021, it surpassed 1 billion streams on Spotify. It remains Mraz's biggest US hit single to date. It was the only song to crack Billboard's top 600 of all time chart despite never cracking the top 5.\n\nMraz first launched the song from the La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California, at Michele Clark's Sunset Sessions in 2008. He also sang a version on Sesame Street titled \"Outdoors\" and released a successful remixed version featuring Lil Wayne and Jah Cure.\n\nThroughout 2008, \"I'm Yours\" slowly increased in airplay and digital sales and would go on to become Mraz's biggest hit to date, charting higher than his previous pop hit, 2003's \"The Remedy (I Won't Worry)\". It became his first top ten single in the US, peaking at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the Pop 100. On the Billboard Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart, the song was number one for a total of nine weeks. The single later received Mainstream Top 40 airplay, eventually topping that chart as well. Due to its gradually building crossover appeal, the song has had extremely unusual longevity, not reaching number one on the Mainstream Top 40 until December 2008, ten months after its release and seven months after it debuted on the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown. In fact, VH1 had already retired the song in early October 2008 after a 20-week run. The song returned to the top ten of the Hot 100 for the third time in its 38th week on the chart. \"I'm Yours\" would go on to chart for a total of 76 weeks, making this the longest chart run in Billboard magazine history, up until the 87-week run of Imagine Dragons' \"Radioactive\" and the 79-week run of AWOLNATION's \"Sail\", both set in 2014.\n\nA year into its release, it topped another chart for the first time, when it hit number one on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks during the week of February 5, 2009. This marked 11 months since the song had topped its first chart in the US, when it reached number one on the Triple A chart in March 2008. \"I'm Yours\" spent 16 weeks at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. In addition, after topping the Adult Contemporary chart, \"I'm Yours\" became the first song to top the Triple A, Adult Top 40, Mainstream Top 40, and Adult Contemporary charts. Despite weak initial download sales, it became the eighth best-selling digital song in the United States by January 2012. It has sold 6,837,000 copies in the US as of April 23, 2014.\n\nIt is Mraz's most successful global single to date, reaching number one in Sweden and Norway, and the top ten in Canada, United States, Austria, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Italy. It was also able to reach number one on the Top 40 Digital Track Chart in Australia. In Hawaii, radio stations do play the original version, along with a Hawaiian remix of the song. \"I'm Yours\" was also a huge hit in New Zealand where it peaked at number one, knocking off \"Poker Face\" which spent ten consecutive weeks at number one. It was certified gold after nine weeks selling over 7,500 copies and then certified platinum after 14 weeks selling over 15,000 copies.\n\n\"I'm Yours\" made its debut on the UK Singles Chart on December 12, 2008, at number 78 and then slowly climbed up the chart until it peaked at number 11. It spent the whole of 2009 on the chart apart from the final two weeks of the year, then re-entered in January 2010 and again in August, and has now clocked up 56 weeks on the official UK Top 75, making it currently the 15th longest runner of all time and the longest never to make the top 10, at 84 weeks on the top 100.\n\nThe music video debuted on March 14, 2008. I'm Yours was later featured as the Record of the Week on Scott Mills's BBC Radio One show on November 10, 2008. Since being added to YouTube it has been viewed over 620 million times as of late March 2021. It was filmed in Hawaii (Oahu and Kauai) in 2008 with veteran music video director Darren Doane.\n\n\"I'm Yours\" was featured in the episode \"All About Appearances\" from the television series \"Privileged\". It was also used for the Australian Seven Network's promotion of the season premiere of \"Packed to the Rafters\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Mraz/_/I%27m+Yours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Ballroom meets exotic dancing.\n\nMraz told the story of the song to Rolling Stone (Source Butterfly Songfacts) : \"When I took a break to make this record, I joined my roommate Bushwalla's band — I was the guitarist and background vocalist. There was a young woman in the band who would also do a burlesque show and invited us to go see her. And I was watching this burlesque show thinking, 'Man, I wonder if my music is played in any exotic clubs anywhere in the world? I sincerely doubt it.' That challenged me: I went home, and I thought, 'I'm going to see if I can't write a song that a young woman would want to model her shoes to.' I don't know if the girl ever found out, but it's definitely one of the more fun songs in the live show.\"  <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Mraz/_/Butterfly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "name": "The Prodigy",
        "bio": "The Prodigy is an English electronic dance music band from Braintree, Essex, formed in 1990 by keyboardist and songwriter Liam Howlett. The line-up of the band has included MC and vocalist Maxim, dancer and vocalist Keith Flint (until his death in March 2019), dancer and live keyboardist Leeroy Thornhill (who left to pursue a solo career in 1999), and dancer and vocalist Sharky (1990-1991). Along with the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, The Prodigy are credited as pioneers of the breakbeat-influenced genre big beat, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. Howlett's rock inspired drum rhythms infused with electronic rave music beats/breaks were combined with Maxim's omnipresent mystique, Thornhill's shuffle dancing style and Flint's modern punk appearance.\n\nThe Prodigy first emerged in the underground rave scene in the early 1990s and achieved popularity and worldwide recognition with UK number one singles such as \"Firestarter\" and \"Breathe\", both singles coming from their UK and US chart topping album The Fat of the Land (1997). A third single from the album, “Smack My Bitch Up”, was also successful. They earned titles like \"the premiere dance act for the alternative masses\" and \"the Godfathers of Rave\", and remain one of the most successful electronic acts of all time. They have sold an estimated 25 million records worldwide, and won numerous music awards during their career, including two Brit Awards for Best British Dance Act, three MTV Video Music Awards, two Kerrang! Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards, and received two Grammy Award nominations.\n\nThe Prodigy were founded in Braintree, Essex, in 1990 by keyboardist and songwriter Liam Howlett. He had taken piano lessons in his youth and gained the ability to play difficult passages in just a few run-throughs. After he decided to pursue a music career, Howlett met dancer and vocalist Keith Flint in mid-1989 at a rave at which Howlett was DJing. After Flint requested Howlett make a mix tape for him, Howlett obliged, returning a cassette several days later with a collection of his own songs on the other side. Howlett had scratched the word \"Prodigy\" onto the cassette, the same name as the Moog Prodigy analogue synthesiser, and Howlett's moniker. The tape was well-received by Flint and keyboardist Leeroy Thornhill who developed new dance sequences to the music and suggested to Howlett they begin a group together. They were soon joined by MC and vocalist Maxim, then known as Maxim Reality, and female dancer and vocalist Sharky, a friend of Flint's. Together they became the first line-up of the Prodigy.\n\nOn 4 March 2019, Keith Flint was found dead at his home in Essex, just weeks after playing six live dates in Australia and New Zealand. On 5 March, the band announced on Twitter that \"all forthcoming concerts in 2019 would be canceled, effective immediately\".\n\nFollowing Flint's death, fans began using the Twitter hashtag \"Firestarter4Number1\" on various social media platforms to get \"Firestarter\" to top the British singles charts again. This was done out of respect for Keith Flint and to raise awareness of suicide among men.\n\nOn 20 August 2019, one day before his 48th birthday, Liam Howlett posted on the band's official Instagram page, saying he is \"back in the studio making noise [...] brand new Prodigy tunes are gonna roll\", referring to his intention to keep on releasing music under the Prodigy moniker.\n\nAlong with the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, the Prodigy have been credited as pioneers of the big beat genre, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. The Prodigy, however, is not considered entirely representative of the genre as their production \"often reflected the more intelligent edge of trip-hop, and rarely broke into the mindless arena of true big beat\" according to AllMusic. The Prodigy are also considered alternative dance, techno, electronica, breakbeat hardcore, and rave.\n\nLiam Howlett cited early electro as a big influence, mentioning tunes like \"Clear\" by American music group Cybotron and \"Al Naafiysh\" by Hashim. Liam Howlett also cited The Bomb Squad, Public Enemy, and Rage Against the Machine as influences. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was released by XL Recordings on June 30, 1997 (and on July 1, 1997 in the U.S.).\n\nThe album caused some controversy in the UK. The video for the first single, \"Firestarter\", caused a minor uproar because of vocalist Keith Flint's appearance, and several people objected to the seeming misogyny of \"Smack My Bitch Up\", though the band maintains that its true interpretation is \"...doing anything intensely...\"\n\n\"Mindfields\" later appeared on the soundtrack of the film The Matrix, while \"Smack My Bitch Up\" has appeared in both Charlie's Angels and Closer. \"Funky Shit\" appeared in the trailers for the film Event Horizon and also played over the end credits.\n\n\"Serial Thrilla\" features a sample of a riff by Skunk Anansie, \"Funky Shit\" features a sample from \"Root Down\" from the Beastie Boys album Ill Communication, \"Fuel My Fire\" is a cover of an L7 song from Hungry for Stink. \"Smack My Bitch Up\" takes a sample from an Ultramagnetic MCs song, \"Give the Drummer Some\", and thus the Prodigy invited Kool Keith to do the lyrics and vocals for another track, \"Diesel Power.\" Matt Cameron of Soundgarden, who is falsely credited as \"Mark\" in the liner notes, is also understood to have contributed samples to the album, though it is not clear where.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. The album has since gone double platinum selling over 2 million copies in the U.S.\n\nThe album entered the Guinness World Records as the fastest-selling UK album in 1999 and was also nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\nThe album was nominated for the 1997 Mercury Music Prize.\n\nIn 1998 Q magazine readers voted The Fat of the Land the ninth greatest album of all time.

It is the first studio album released by the band since 2004's Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned and is the first Prodigy album since 1997's The Fat of the Land to feature all three members of the band.\n\nDetails about the album were released on November 4, through The Prodigy's official newsletter and confirmed the same day by Liam on The Zane Lowe Show on BBC Radio 1. The band have said that the album will go back to their \"old-school but cutting edge\" roots, and will feature collaborations with Dave Grohl (of Foo Fighters) and James Rushent (of Does It Offend You, Yeah?), but will not feature any guest vocals. The album will be released as a CD, CD/DVD set, Double vinyl, digital download and a luxury 7-inch vinyl box set which will include five 7-inches, CD/DVD, bonus CD, poster, stickers and stencils.\n\nThe first track, also entitled \"Invaders Must Die\", was released as a free download from the band's website on the November 26, coinciding with its first airing on Zane Lowe's show, as his \"Hottest Record in the World\". Omen was the first single released off the album on February 16.\n\nTo coincide with the release of the album, the band will embark on a nine date, UK arena tour, with support from Dizzee Rascal and Fight Like Apes. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/Invaders+Must+Die\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Music for the Jilted Generation is an album by British band The Prodigy. The album was released through XL Recordings in July 1994. The album was re-released in 2008 as More Music for the Jilted Generation. The re-release includes remastered and bonus tracks.\n\nIt is largely a response to the corruption of the rave scene in England by its mainstream status as well as Great Britain's Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which effectively criminalised raves, rave culture, and by implication, rave music itself. The latter is exemplified in the song \"Their Law\" (predominant lyric: \"Fuck 'em and their law\"), and the spoken word intro, which paraphrases a quote from The Lawnmower Man.\n\nWhen Liam Howlett came to the cutting room for the final phase in the album production he realized that all the tracks he had originally planned for wouldn't fit onto a CD so One Love had to be edited, The Heat (The Energy) was slightly cut and the track called \"We Eat Rhythm\" was left out. \"We Eat Rhythm\" was later released on a free cassette with Select Magazine in October '94 entitled 'Select Future Tracks'.\n\nThe cover of the inner artwork of the record was analysed in an article published in 2008 in the techno underground Magazine Datacide. The author compares the picture with a persiflage which was published in 2003 on the Kid606 album Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You. The article not only describes the representation of Raves in graphic artwork but also describes the marketing strategy of the band with the album and criticises it from a pretentious point of view:\n\n    'With the picture The Prodigy are taking a stance in the conflict of ravers versus the police in those days. At the same time this statement is used to market a rebellious attitude. The picture is part of the artwork of a record - which is of course a commodity. The teenage (and male) consumer ought to identify himself with the presented rebellion. With the help of the artwork a certain image of The Prodigy is established: They should be seen as anti-stars, who define themselves through refusal and opposition.\n\n    * Rolling Stone (20 April 1995, p.80) - 3.5 Stars - Very Good - \"A soundtrack for those British rave hordes who dodge Tory truncheons, Music for the Jilted Generation thrills initiates with a political buzz Americans might miss. But the Prodigy's hard-core techno generates universal dance fever....Truly trippy.\"\n\n    * Alternative Press (April 1995, p.84) - \"Jilted Generation throws much darker shapes than its predecessor. Moreover, it slams harder and rawer and covers more ground--21st century hip hop, Latin funk, horror trance, Vapourspace-like ambient--in addition to their usual crowd-pleasing, hi-NRG tekno. Thumbs up for the use of guitar and flute, too.\"\n\n    * Option (July–August 1995, pp. 129–131) – \"...the Prodigy jolts an industrial sensibility with techno drive and then rides the seemingly endless grooves until we're numb...for intensely pumping dance music, this album has more life than most.\"\n\n    * Mojo (p.56) - Ranked #83 in Mojo's \"100 Modern Classics\" – \"One-man Bomb Squad Liam Howlett was a breakbeat maker without peer.\"\n\n    * Spin (September 1999, p.150) - Ranked #60 in Spin's \"90 Greatest Albums of the '90s\".\n\n    * NME (24 December 1994, p.22) - Ranked #9 in NME's list of the \"Top 50 Albums Of 1994\".\n\n    * Q - Voted the 62nd greatest album of all time by Q readers in early 1998 and ranked one of the best British albums of the last 50 years in 2008.\n\n    * It is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n    * On 4 December 2008, Zane Lowe inducted it into his 'masterpieces' by playing the album in full on his BBC Radio 1 show.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/Music+for+the+Jilted+Generation\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released in the UK on August 23, 2004 by XL Recordings, and in the US on September 15, 2004 by Mute Records/Maverick Records. It is the first The Prodigy studio album after 1997's The Fat of the Land. Its title is a play on words of the title to the Walter Mosely novel Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned.\n\nOf the three The Prodigy members, only Liam Howlett is present on the album musically. Contributors included actress Juliette Lewis, Oasis frontmen Liam and Noel Gallagher, Kool Keith and The Magnificent Ping Pong Bitches. \"This album is about reminding people what The Prodigy was always about — the beats and the music\", Howlett wrote to an internet zine after finishing the album. He also notes that his intention was to use vocals mostly as an extension of the sound rather than the main focal point, as was the case in The Fat of the Land. A limited edition of 5000 was released, sporting a black, inverted cover variant and no other extras. In Japan the album contained a reworked version of Girls, entitled \"More Girls\" which features Maxim on vocals.\n\nThe album peaked at Number 1 on the UK album charts, although for one week only, and performed decently in Australia reaching Number 6 on the Aria Album Chart. With three singles the album yielded no big hits in any country. It was promoted by a promotional double A-sided 12\" \"Girls/Memphis Bells\", released in very limited quantities in UK on June 21, 2004. On June 28, 2004, the track \"Memphis Bells\" was exclusively available online as a digital download via alwaysoutnumbered.com. Available in a limited edition, each of the 5,000 downloads had a unique variation of the track, accompanied with a unique variation of the artwork.\n\nOn 30 August 2004 \"Girls\" was released, entering the charts at #19. \"Hotride\" – released November 1, 2004 in the UK – was not eligible to enter the UK charts as the CD was released in EP format with 3 additional 'b-sides' and so did not conform to chart regulations. Finally \"Spitfire\" was released on March 28, 2005 as a promotional single for the 2005 film, House of Wax. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/Always+Outnumbered,+Never+Outgunned\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Experience is the debut studio album by English electronic dance music band The Prodigy. It was first released on 28 September 1992 through XL Recordings. It peaked at No. 12 in the UK Albums Chart in October. A wide variety of artists in the breakbeat hardcore scene in the early 1990s are given respect and namechecked in the sleeve notes of the album, including SL2, Carl Cox, Moby, Tim Westwood, and Aphex Twin. On 19 June 2001, an expanded edition of the album was released in the United States, featuring a bonus disc of remixes and B-sides. It was released in the United Kingdom seven years later on 4 August 2008 as Experience: Expanded, with a gold cover and two extra tracks. Experience has been well-received critically. Allmusic gave the album 5 out of 5 stars, opining that it \"shows the Prodigy near the peak of their game from the get go\" and stating that \"almost every song sounds like a potential chart topper\". All songs written and composed by Liam Howlett. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/Experience\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "The Day Is My Enemy is the sixth studio album by English electronic music group The Prodigy. It was released on 30 March 2015 by record labels Take Me to the Hospital/Cooking Vinyl in the UK and Three Six Zero Music/Warner Bros. Records in the United States.\n\nRecorded across a timespan of six years, the album marks the first time that band members Maxim and Keith Flint have been actively involved in the songwriting process. The album title is a reference to the Cole Porter song 'All Through the Night', in particular its lyrics \"the day is my enemy, the night my friend\", although it is the Ella Fitzgerald version that first inspired the title track.\n\nDue to a general lack of interest in albums and the time spent in making them, The Day Is My Enemy was initially speculated by the band to be their last album as they would shift towards releasing EPs, however the band would sign a worldwide record publishing deal with BMG Rights Management in September 2017, and released a follow-up album, No Tourists, in 2018. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/The+Day+Is+My+Enemy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Smack My Bitch Up\" was the twelfth single released by the British big beat band The Prodigy on November 17, 1997. It was the third and final single from the album The Fat of the Land. The song was highly controversial because its lyrics, title and music video were believed to promote using of heroin. The phrase \"Smack my bitch up\" translates to: \"Request another to inject you with Heroin or get you high. The phrase does not mean to hit your girlfriend, nor does it advocate violence toward women as it literally implies. \"Bitch\" being slang for the main vein running down your arm in which heroin is usually injected. \n\"Smack\" is slang for the drug heroin. Put them together and you get \"Smack my bitch up\", in other words to inject heroin into your main vein in your arm. \n\n\nThe lyrics \"Change my pitch up / Smack my bitch up\" are repeated through the whole song, as can be heard in the sample below. The band defended the song, saying that the lyrics were being misinterpreted as misogynistic  and the song actually meant \"...doing anything intensely...\"  The song led to a publicised disagreement at the 1998 Reading festival after the Beastie Boys asked the group not to play the track. The vocals are sampled and altered from the Ultramagnetic MCs song \"Give the Drummer Some\". The original lyrics, performed by rapper Kool Keith, are: \"Switch up change my pitch up / Smack my bitch up like a pimp\". Keith had previously been sampled by the Prodigy in the track \"Out of Space\". The female vocals in \"Smack My Bitch Up\" were performed by Shahin Badar.\n\nThe track also contains samples from \"Funky Man\" by Kool & the Gang; \"In Memory Of\" by Randy Weston; \"Bulls on Parade\" by Rage Against the Machine; \"House of Rising Funk\" by Afrique and \"Nana - The Dreaming\" by Sheila Chandra\n\nPrior to the release of the single Liam Howlett was presented with three remixes of the title song, one by Jonny L, one by DJ Hype and one by Slacker. Eventually, Howlett chose the DJ Hype remix to be released on the single. The Jonny L remix was released through a free CD that came along with the January issue of Muzik magazine in 1998, while the Slacker remix was never officially released, although it surfaced on a rare and limited set of white labels.\n\nThe song was banned by the BBC and only a lyric-free version was played on Radio 1. On the chart rundown, other tracks from the single release were played, and the title \"Smack My Bitch Up\" was not mentioned. On BBC World Service radio chart run down it was mentioned as \"Smack\" and was not played. Yet on the first episode of Top of the Pops in which it charted, the DJ Hype remix was played over the Top 10 countdown, including the offending lyric of \"Change my pitch up, Smack my bitch up.\"\n\nRichard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered this song on his 2000 album Lounge Against the Machine. This is the song where he introduces the whole band.\n\nThe song appears in the 2000 film Charlie's Angels, however the song is not on the film's soundtrack. It also appears in the 2001 film Scary Movie 2, in the scene that spoofs the Charlie's Angels' scene that uses this song.\n\nThe song \"No Man Army\" appears on the single and is a slightly different instrumental version of \"One Man Army\", a song which Howlett created together with guitarist Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave for the soundtrack to the movie Spawn.\n\nThe song is used in the Mike Nichols film Closer and the first episode of the BBC Three series Being Human. However, it is not included on the DVD release due to copyright issues.\n\nThe promotional music video for \"Smack My Bitch Up\", directed by Swede Jonas Åkerlund depicts a night out in the city filmed from a first-person perspective, portraying drinking and driving, snorting cocaine, violence, vandalism, nudity and sex. The unedited version also includes a scene of heroin  use and a hit and run incident. The protagonist takes a stripper (played by model Teresa May) home and has sex with her. As the stripper leaves with her stuff, the protagonist glances in the mirror, is revealed to be a woman, and passes out on the bed.\n\nThe video drew fierce criticism for misogyny  despite its ending, particularly from feminist groups such as the National Organization for Women, accusing it of encouraging violence against women. Others, however, praised the video because of the way it subverted politically correct stereotypes of domestic violence, showing that women are also abusers. Though universally banned from television, massive demands on MTV eventually had them relent and show the video, but only after midnight and following an MTV News  warning. In mid-2002, the full unedited version of this video was aired on MTV2 as part of a special countdown showing the most controversial videos ever to air on MTV. This countdown was only shown late at night because of the graphic imagery of \"Smack My Bitch Up\" and several other videos on the countdown. This video was at #1 on the countdown and therefore named the \"Most Controversial Video\" in MTV's history. Programming blocks in the United States containing the unedited video for \"Smack My Bitch Up\" automatically gained a rating of TV-MA-SLV (previously TV-M-DSLV).\n\nDespite the controversy, the video would be nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards, and eventually win Best Dance Video and Breakthrough Video.\n\nIn 2006 the full version of this video was aired and voted #1 on New Zealand television show 'U Choose 40', screened on music channel C4 as part of their 'Most Shocking Videos' and 'Top 10 - That's Shocking!' (June 10, 2007) countdowns and voted #2 as part of the 'Banned In The USA!' countdown on August 24, 2007.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the single didn't prevent \"Smack My Bitch Up\" from being a massive worldwide hit. The song reached the top 15 in several countries, for example Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. The song performed best in Finland, securing The Prodigy their third Finnish number-one hit alongside Firestarter and Breathe. Although not reaching the top 20 in those countries, \"Smack My Bitch Up\" was a hit in the Netherlands peaking at #22, in Australia  reaching #41, and in the United States reaching #89. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/_/Smack+My+Bitch+Up\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was also the group's first number-one single on the UK Singles Chart, staying on top for three weeks.\n\nIt was The Prodigy's first big national and international hit, also reaching number one in Finland and Norway. It featured Flint's punky vocals which showcased him as the group's frontman. The title and lyrics were subject of controversy in the UK because of their violent nature. The music video further boosted these controversies.\n\nThe songwriting credits—among Liam Howlett and Keith Flint—include Kim Deal of alt-rock group The Breeders. The looped wah-wah guitar riff in \"Firestarter\" was sampled from The Breeders' track \"S.O.S.\" from the album Last Splash. Because of the use of a sample from a 1984 single \"Close (To the Edit)\" songwriting credits also list Art of Noise's then-members: Anne Dudley, Trevor Horn, J.J. Jeczalik, Gary Langan and Paul Morley. The \"Emperion Mix,\" which does not include these samples, is credited solely to Howlett and Flint. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/_/Firestarter\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was the third single from the album Music For the Jilted Generation and was released as a 12\" single and its own EP in the United States through Mute Records.\nThe British release included a remix by The Chemical Brothers who at that time called themselves \"The Dust Brothers\" in honour of an American producer duo of the same name. When \"Voodoo People\" was to be released in the States, and due to the British Dust Brothers' rising popularity, the American Dust Brothers threatened a lawsuit if they didn't change their name. The British duo changed their name to \"The Chemical Brothers\", and the remix on the American Mute release was renamed in accordance. A small sample in the remix was also reversed on the American release due to copyright issues.\nThe original video was directed by Walter Stern and Russell Curtis. It was filmed on location in Saint Lucia and it showed Leeroy Thornhill as a voodoo priest. This version included scenes featuring real witch Doctors, but these were cut because of problems with television censorship. A number of other more graphic versions of the video are available, one of them appearing in the Prodigy's Electronic Punks documentary.[citation needed]\nThe spoken parts (\"... the voodoo who do what you don't dare do people...\") are taken from \"The Shalimar,\" written and performed by Gylan Kain, one of The Last Poets.\nThe main riff in the song is based on a sample of the Nirvana song \"Very Ape\" from their third studio album In Utero.\nThe song has been covered by Refused and British funk band 6ix Toys as well remixed by Pendulum (see Voodoo People (Pendulum Remix)) and other known and less known artists such as Eskimo and Shayning. The track has also been a part of many soundtracks, such as Hackers, Doberman, etc. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Prodigy/_/Voodoo+People\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Coco & Clair Clair are a pop duo from Atlanta, Georgia. Pioneers of “demon glam rock,” their unapologetic & unmistakably hip-hop-influenced sound breathes new life into the lo-fi bedroom pop genre. The two met on Twitter in 2012 and soon after started recording songs together alongside Atlanta's Awful Records crew.\n\nApril 2017 marked the release of their first project, Posh, a seven-track album which features ’Sims 2,’ a quarantine anthem released three years ahead of its time. “I’m in my bedroom, playing Sims 2, what about you?”\n\nIn 2018, Coco & Clair Clair began to build more buzz and play shows across state lines--blessing their fans with a few more iconic singles along the way: ‘Pretty’, ‘Naomi & Kate,’ & ‘Bugs’.\n\n2019 saw the duo performing in Texas, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, & Atlanta. At the girls’ headlining LA debut, Bay Area legend Kreayshawn DJ’d their set--foreshadowing a future collaboration. Later that month, the girls joined Clairo to perform their new song ‘Racecar’ together for the first time in front of a sold-out crowd at Atlanta’s Variety Playhouse.\n\nIn April, 2020, Coco & Clair Clair followed up ‘Racecar’ with a new EP, Treat Like Gold, which features Kreayshawn and a remix of ‘Pretty’. On ‘TLG’, their title track with Kreayshawn, The Fader wrote, “It’s a stilted, strange song, but, like most of Coco & Clair Clair’s music, that’s what makes it fun.”\n\nCoco & Clair Clair are your new favorite pop girlies, and we have no choice but to stan. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Coco+&+Clair+Clair\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Rainha da Favela\" is a song that celebrates self-confidence, empowerment, and sensuality. The lyrics depict the artist asserting her dominance and status as the queen of the favela (a Brazilian term for a low-income neighborhood or slum) while embracing her own body and sexuality.\n\nIn the verses, Ludmilla emphasizes her attractive features and skillful abilities with a playful tone. The line \"My pussy mata rindo\" (My pussy kills while laughing) showcases her self-assured attitude. She presents herself as assertive and powerful, having already conquered many admirers.\n\nThe repeated chorus, \"Foca no meu bumbum\" (Focus on my butt), calls attention to Ludmilla's physical assets, highlighting her confidence and unapologetic attitude towards her own sexuality. The repetition of this phrase reinforces her body positivity and encourages others to appreciate her natural beauty.\n\nThe bridge suggests a moment of intimacy, where she invites someone to relax and enjoy themselves in her company. The lines \"Respeita o serviço, nego / Não te dou uma semana, pedindo pra voltar\" (Respect the service, babe / I won't give you a week before you ask to come back) demonstrate her self-assured nature and demand for respect within any romantic or sexual encounters.\n\nOverall, \"Rainha da Favela\" celebrates Ludmilla's self-empowerment, sensuality, and her position as a strong woman in her community. The song expresses a message of self-love, body positivity, and not being afraid to assert oneself and embrace individuality. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ludmilla/_/Rainha+da+Favela\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is best known for his music, which often includes social, economic and cultural reflections on Brazil.\n\nThe firstborn son of Sérgio Buarque de Hollanda, Buarque lived at several locations throughout his childhood, though mostly in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Rome. He wrote and studied literature as a child and found music through the bossa nova compositions of Tom Jobim and João Gilberto. He performed as a singer and guitarist in the 1960s as well as writing a play that was deemed dangerous by the Brazilian military dictatorship of the time. Buarque, along with several Tropicalist and MPB musicians, was threatened by the Brazilian military government and eventually left Brazil for Italy in 1969. However, he came back to Brazil in 1970, and continued to record, perform, and write, though much of his material was suppressed by government censors. He released several more albums in the 1980s and published three novels in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nIn 2019, Buarque was awarded the Camões Prize, the most important prize for literature in the Portuguese language. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chico+Buarque\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Construção é um disco do cantor e compositor brasileiro Chico Buarque, lançado em 1971 e composto em períodos entre o exílio de Chico na Itália e sua volta ao Brasil. Liricamente, o álbum é carregado de críticas ao regime militar vigente, principalmente no que concerne à censura imposta pelo governo (\"Cordão\") e pelo estado indigno no qual as condições individuais se encontravam no país (\"Construção\"), além de algumas canções mais clássicas e pessoais (\"Valsinha\" e \"Minha História\").\nO disco marca o aguçamento da vertente crítica da poética do autor.\nSe antes ele harmonizava Bossa Nova com composições veladamente críticas à ditadura brasileira, em \"Construção\" o cantor mostrou-se mais ousado - como indica os versos iniciais de \"Deus lhe Pague\", faixa que abre o LP (\"Por esse pão pra comer, por esse chão pra dormir\"). Em \"Samba de Orly\", parceria com Toquinho e Vinicius de Moraes, Chico canta abertamente sobre o exílio - o que fez com que a canção fosse parcialmente censurada. A faixa-título é uma crítica sobre um homem que trabalhou arduamente até sua morte. Não faltaram também o lirismo característico do artista, como demostrado em \"Olha Maria\" e \"Valsinha\". O álbum conta com arranjos de Magro, então integrante do grupo MPB-4, e do maestro Rogério Duprat. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chico+Buarque/Constru%C3%A7%C3%A3o\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Foi eleito o 3º melhor disco brasileiro de 2017 pela revista Rolling Stone Brasil.\n\nAs gravações do álbum decorreram no Rio de Janeiro no período de dois anos, em intervalos de três meses. As músicas, depois de gravadas, foram para um HD, que foi colocado dentro de um cofre instalado na gravadora Biscoito Fino, para evitar hackers.\n\nNo dia 28 de julho de 2017 foi lançado o single Tua Cantiga, nas plataformas digitais.\n\nO álbum de Chico Buarque já era esperado pelos fãs e pela imprensa desde o fim de 2016. A assessoria de imprensa do músico negou os rumores, dizendo que apenas algumas bases haviam sido gravadas.\n\nA foto da capa foi fotografada por Leo Aversa, com projeto gráfico de Cássia D'Elia.\n\nO álbum teve uma edição em disco de vinil, que foi lançada em dezembro de 2017.\n\nA tiragem inicial do CD ''Caravanas'' foi de 20 mil cópias.\n\nEm agosto de 2017, a faixa \"Tua Cantiga\" causou polêmica. Em um verso, Chico Buarque diz: \"Largo mulher e filhos e de joelhos vou te seguir\". Pela frase, Buarque foi acusado de machismo. Ele relatou em seu Facebook oficial ter ouvido numa fila de supermercado o seguinte diálogo: - \"Será que é machismo um homem largar a família para ficar com a amante? - Pelo contrário. Machismo é ficar com a família e a amante\", ironizando a polêmica. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chico+Buarque/Caravanas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Elis Regina Carvalho Costa (March 17, 1945, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil – January 19, 1982, São Paulo, Brazil), better known as Elis Regina, was a Brazilian singer and one of the biggest names of MPB. Known for her vocal competence, musicianship and stage presence, she was acclaimed both in Brazil and internationally.\n\nIn the '60s, Elis was a leader and a standard-bearer in defense of Brazilian popular music, heavily contributing to the formation of the MPB label, with commercial and ideological characteristics at the same time. She was the first major artist to emerge from music festivals in the 1960s and detached herself from the Bossa Nova aesthetic through the use of her vocal range and drama. Initially, her style was influenced by radio singers, especially Ângela Maria. After four unsuccessful studio albums — Viva a Brotolândia (1961), Poema de Amor (1962), Elis Regina (1963), O Bem do Amor (1963) — Elis was the biggest revelation of the TV Excelsior festival in 1965, when he sang \"Arrastão\" by Vinícius de Moraes and Edu Lobo. This feat would guarantee him the invitation to act on television and, shortly afterwards, the title of first star of Brazilian popular song, when he started to command, alongside Jair Rodrigues, one of the two most important Brazilian popular music programs, O Fino da bossa. In 1967, she married Ronaldo Bôscoli, then director of O Fino da Bossa. From 1972, Elis began a relationship with César Camargo Mariano, which would last until 1981, in one of the most successful partnerships in Brazilian Popular Music.\n\nShe sang many genres: MPB, bossa nova, samba, rock and jazz. Interpreting songs like \"Madalena\", \"Águas de Março\", \"Atrás da Porta\", \"Como Nosso Pais\", \"O Bêbado e a Equilibrista\" and \"Querellas do Brasil\", he recorded moments of happiness, love, sadness and patriotism. Throughout his career, he stood out for also singing songs by artists, still little known, such as Milton Nascimento, Ivan Lins, Belchior, Renato Teixeira, Aldir Blanc, João Bosco, helping to launch them and publicize their works. , boosting them in the Brazilian music scene. Among other partnerships, the duets she had with Jair Rodrigues, Tom Jobim and Rita Lee are famous. With her second husband, pianist César Camargo Mariano, she consecrated a long work of great creativity and musical consistency and, in technical terms, was considered the best brazilian singer. His most memorable artistic presence is perhaps registered on the albums Em Pleno Verão (1970), Elis (1972), Elis (1973), Elis & Tom (1974), Elis (1974), Falso Brilhante (1976), Transversal do Tempo (1978). ), Essa Mulher (1979), Saudade do Brasil (1980) and Elis (1980). She was the first person to inscribe her own voice as if it were an instrument, in the Order of Musicians of Brazil. In 2013, she was elected the best female voice in Brazilian music by Rolling Stone Magazine. Elis was also mentioned in the list of the greatest artists in Brazilian music, ranking 14th, being the best-placed woman. In November of the same year, a musical was premiered in honor of her Elis, the musical.\n\nElis Regina died prematurely at the age of 36, at the height of her career, causing strong commotion in the country and leaving a vast body of work in Brazilian popular music. Although there were controversies and disputes as to the cause of death, the tests showed that the cause was the consumption of cocaine associated with alcohol, which caused a cardiac arrest. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elis+Regina\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In a restrained and smooth way, she interprets several classics of the genre, such as \"Águas de Março\" (which became the album's biggest hit), \"Corcovado\", \"Inútil Landscape\", sometimes in a duet with Jobim, which in other moments only accompanies her on guitar or piano. \"Modinha\" was the only song on the record to be fully arranged by Jobim.\n\nElis & Tom was a sales and critical success, and continues to be acclaimed to this day by musicians and critics worldwide. On its 30th anniversary, in 2004, it had a special re-release and, until 2013, it was one of the albums highlighted in the iTunes sales charts in Brazil. In addition, Elis & Tom has been remembered in the main Brazilian and international music books, compendia and encyclopedias and, in 2007, it was chosen by journalists and music critics as the 11th best album in Brazilian music by Rolling Stone. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elis+Regina/Elis+&+Tom\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Segundo o Jornal do Brasil, o álbum vendeu cerca de 182 mil cópias no Brasil, até 23 de março de 1980, sendo o disco mais vendido da carreira da cantora.\n Em 1975, Elis Regina estreou uma temporada solo intitulada Falso Brilhante, com o objetivo de contar sua história, vida e carreira, sem deixar de lado as críticas à ditadura militar brasileira. Tudo isso num ambiente um tanto circense. As apresentações, sob direção cênica de Myriam Muniz e direção musical de Cesar Camargo Mariano, ocorreram no Teatro Bandeirantes, ficando em cartaz por praticamente dois anos, de 1975 a 1977. Ocorreram, apenas em São Paulo, 257 apresentações, com público aproximado de 280 mil pessoas. O título, Falso Brilhante, foi extraído do bolero “Dois pra lá, dois pra cá”, de João Bosco e Aldir Blanc, lançado por Elis em 1974, sendo ressignificado como metáfora de sua vida. Nesse espetáculo, Elis interpretou duas canções (Como Nossos Pais e Velha Roupa Colorida) escritas pelo músico e intérprete cearense Belchior.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elis+Regina/Falso+Brilhante\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Glee was an American musical comedy-drama television series that aired on the Fox network in the United States from May 19, 2009, to March 20, 2015. It focused on a high school show choir, also known as a glee club, set within the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio.\n\nGlee featured multiple major and secondary roles who have contributed vocals to the show: Lea Michele, Matthew Morrison,  Dianna Agron,  Cory Monteith, Amber Riley, Chris Colfer, Mark Salling, Jenna Ushkowitz, Kevin McHale, Naya Rivera, Heather Morris, Jayma Mays, Jane Lynch, Chord Overstreet, Darren Criss, Harry Shum, Jr., Damian McGinty, Vanessa Lengies, Samuel Larsen, Blake Jenner, Alex Newell, Melissa Benoist, Jacob Artist, and Dean Geyer. Numerous special guests have also featured on tracks, including Jonathan Groff, Kristin Chenoweth, Grant Gustin, Olivia Newton-John, John Stamos, Neil Patrick Harris, Idina Menzel, Charice, Gwyneth Paltrow, k.d. lang, Ricky Martin, Matt Bomer, Kate Hudson, and Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nThe pilot episode of the show was broadcast on May 19, 2009 and the first season began airing on September 9, 2009. The show was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. Murphy selects all music featured within the series himself, with the intent of maintaining a balance between show tunes and chart hits. Songs featured on the show are available for digital download through iTunes up to two weeks before new episodes air, and through other digital outlets and mobile carriers a week later. \n\nTheir debut single, \"Don't Stop Believin'\", a cover of the 1981 Journey song, was a top ten hit, and was certified platinum in Australia and gold in the US. The group's cover of The All-American Rejects' \"Gives You Hell\" reached number one in Ireland, giving them their first number one single. \n\nThere has been Nineteen soundtracks released through Columbia Records: Glee: The Music, Volume 1, Glee: The Music, Volume 2, Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers, Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album, Glee: The Music, Volume 4, Glee: The Music, Volume 5, Glee: The Music, Volume 6, Glee: The Music, Volume 7 and Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album Volume 2,Glee: The Music, Volume 7,Glee: The Music, The Graduation Album,Glee: The Music, Season 4, Volume 1,Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album Volume 3,Glee Sings the Beatles and Glee: The Music - Celebrating 100 Episodes.\n\nNineteen EPs have also been released: Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna, Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals,Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show.Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show,Glee: The Music, Love Songs,Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show,Glee: The Music, Love Songs,Glee: The Music, Dance Party,Britney 2.0,Glee: The Music Presents Glease,The Quarterback (Music from the TV Series),A Katy or a Gaga (Music from the Episode),Movin' Out,Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album Volume 4,City of Angels,New New York,Glee: The Music, Bash,Glee: The Music, Tested,Glee: The Music, Opening Night,Glee: The Music, the Back Up Plan,Glee: The Music, Old Dog, New Tricks,Glee: The Music – The Untitled Rachel Berry Project,Glee: The Music – Loser Like Me and Glee: The Music – Homecoming.\n\nThe cast is second behind The Beatles for most chart appearances by a group act in the Billboard Hot 100's history, and holds the record of sixth overall among all artists, with sixty-nine appearances. The cast has sold over thirty six million and over eleven million albums worldwide. The series' cover versions have also had a positive effect on the original recording artists, with sales of Rihanna's \"Take a Bow\" increasing by 189 percent after the song was covered in the Glee episode \"Showmance\".\n\nThe series features covers of numerous songs sung on-screen by the characters. Musical segments typically take the form of performances, as opposed to the characters singing spontaneously, as the intention is for the series to remain reality-based. Murphy is responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and strives to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, as: \"I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important — the balancing of that.\" Song choices are integral to script development, with Murphy explaining: \"Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along.\"\n\nGlee is choreographed by Zach Woodlee, and features five to eight production numbers per episode. Once music rights are cleared, songs are arranged and pre-recorded by the cast. Woodlee constructs the accompanying dance moves, which are then taught to the cast and filmed. Numbers can take several weeks to prepare, depending on complexity. Each episode costs at least $3 million to produce, and can take up to 10 days to film as a result of the elaborate choreography. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Glee+Cast\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It features cover versions from the first nine episodes of the first season and was released on November 2, 2009 by Columbia Records and 20th Century Fox Television Records. The album received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising large ensemble numbers, but comparing it to karaoke tracks. It went to number one on album charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and peaked at number three in Australia and number four in both Canada and the United States. Volume 1 has been certified platinum in these five countries.\nAll non-bonus tracks from the album have been released as digital singles. The cast's debut single, a cover of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believin'\", charted within the top five in many countries and has sold over one million copies in the US. Other high-charting and best-selling singles include the covers of Queen's \"Somebody to Love\", Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\", and \"Defying Gravity\" from the musical Wicked. Glee Live! In Concert! saw the cast tour the US in promotion of the series' first season and its musical releases. The album earned a nomination for Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media for the 2011 ceremony. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Glee+Cast/Glee:+The+Music,+Volume+1\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Gangsta's Paradise\" is a rap song by Coolio featuring L.V. from the movie Dangerous Minds. The song was later released on the albums Gangsta's Paradise and Dangerous Minds soundtrack in 1995. Coolio was awarded a Grammy for the song/album. The song was voted as the best single of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll.\n\nIt sampled the chorus and music of the song \"Pastime Paradise\" by Stevie Wonder. The song was also listed at #69 on Billboard's Greatest Songs of All-Time. In 2008, it was ranked number 38 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.\n\nFollowing Coolio's appearance in the UK TV show Celebrity Big Brother 2009 Gangsta's Paradise re-entered the UK singles chart peaking at #31. L.V. released a solo version of the single in 1996 on his debut album, I Am L.V. This version did not feature Coolio and featured additional lyrics written by L.V. himself. The single did not repeat the popularity of the original with Coolio.\n\nThe music is a reworking of Stevie Wonder's \"Pastime Paradise\", a song from his album Songs in the Key of Life. \"Gangsta's Paradise\" uses the same tune and a different orchestration of the same backing music. Coolio changed the lyrics to be more relevant to life on the streets.\n\nThe song begins with a line from Psalm 23:4 from the Bible: As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, but then diverges with: I take a look at my life / And realize there's nothin' left. Adding to some of the religious overtones are choral vocals in the background. Many of the lyrics are very dark and tragic and are meant to be a criticism of the violence and tragedy of the \"gangsta\" life. The choral lines (sung by L.V.) Tell me why are we so blind to see / That the ones we hurt are you and me offer an especially plaintive self-criticism. The music video for the song was directed by Antoine Fuqua of Propaganda Films and featured Michelle Pfeiffer reprising her earlier role in Dangerous Minds. When Coolio won Best Rap Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1996, he said in a press conference that Bone Thugs-n-Harmony deserved the award for \"Tha Crossroads\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/_/Gangsta%27s+Paradise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Gangsta's Paradise\" is a rap song by Coolio featuring L.V. from the movie Dangerous Minds. The song was later released on the albums Gangsta's Paradise and Dangerous Minds soundtrack in 1995. Coolio was awarded a Grammy for the song/album. The song was voted as the best single of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll.\n\nIt sampled the chorus and music of the song \"Pastime Paradise\" by Stevie Wonder. The song was also listed at #69 on Billboard's Greatest Songs of All-Time. In 2008, it was ranked number 38 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.\n\nFollowing Coolio's appearance in the UK TV show Celebrity Big Brother 2009 Gangsta's Paradise re-entered the UK singles chart peaking at #31. L.V. released a solo version of the single in 1996 on his debut album, I Am L.V. This version did not feature Coolio and featured additional lyrics written by L.V. himself. The single did not repeat the popularity of the original with Coolio.\n\nThe music is a reworking of Stevie Wonder's \"Pastime Paradise\", a song from his album Songs in the Key of Life. \"Gangsta's Paradise\" uses the same tune and a different orchestration of the same backing music. Coolio changed the lyrics to be more relevant to life on the streets.\n\nThe song begins with a line from Psalm 23:4 from the Bible: As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, but then diverges with: I take a look at my life / And realize there's nothin' left. Adding to some of the religious overtones are choral vocals in the background. Many of the lyrics are very dark and tragic and are meant to be a criticism of the violence and tragedy of the \"gangsta\" life. The choral lines (sung by L.V.) Tell me why are we so blind to see / That the ones we hurt are you and me offer an especially plaintive self-criticism. The music video for the song was directed by Antoine Fuqua of Propaganda Films and featured Michelle Pfeiffer reprising her earlier role in Dangerous Minds. When Coolio won Best Rap Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1996, he said in a press conference that Bone Thugs-n-Harmony deserved the award for \"Tha Crossroads\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Coolio/_/Gangsta%27s+Paradise\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "name": "Frou Frou",
        "bio": "Frou Frou is an electronic music duo formed in England with two members: Imogen Heap and Guy Sigsworth, active from 2002 to 2003. The duo reformed in 2018 and released a live recording of \"Guitar Song\" on April 19, 2019. \n\nFrou Frou created an impressive brand of vocal-driven, electronic pop. After the British duo had been collaborating for years without a record deal, the group's debut, Details, was completed for American release on MCA Records in 2002.\n\nHeap and Sigsworth first worked together on Getting Scared from Heap's 1998 solo record, I Megaphone. After completing the promotion for that splendid debut, Heap was ready to begin work on a new project and the two hooked up again as Sigsworth had privately been compiling music specifically for Heap while producing other projects. The first track, conceived by the new, more formal (but as yet unnamed) pairing, eventually turned into Flicks from Details, which is perhaps Frou Frou's most Björk-reminiscent number. \n\nSigsworth grew up listening to eclectic female artists like Kate Bush, and along with Heap, developed an appreciation for classical music. He has specifically worked with Björk (Homogenic, Vespertine) and Madonna (What It Feels Like For A Girl) among many other significant '90s pop and electronic artists. Far from being the kind of campy moniker one might expect from a more sugary pop outfit, the name Frou Frou was decided upon when Francophile Sigsworth noticed the phrase in a Baudelaire poem. Apparently, when uttered in French, the phrase is meant to approximate the swishing of skirts as they swirl about the legs of comely dancing women, as in a burlesque performance. \n\nBorn composers, multi-instrumentalist Heap and studio/sound/producer/musician Sigsworth are credited with many side appearances in support of other artists, especially Sigsworth, who was often used as a bit of a song-fixer. While those aren't bad jobs to have, artists of Frou Frou's caliber need to step out on their own, and while Heap worked as a solo artist for a majority of her career, Sigsworth had never been so strongly identified with any previous project. Instead of relegating the male producer/writer to a barely credited back seat, as often happens with a female-fronted team effort, Frou Frou was conceived and honestly portrayed as a true collaboration, making it significant for its marketing truthfulness if nothing else. \n\nDetails has some relatively conventional pop moments like \"It's Good to Be in Love\", but more experimental cuts like \"Only Got One\" display a more definitive quality. The true accomplishment of Frou Frou (which is in evidence on just about every track the \"band\" created) is their uncanny ability to infuse highly manipulated, digitally crafted music with a warmth quite rare in pop and almost unheard of in music so technologically progressive. In the studio, Frou Frou achieved unique sounding beats for Heap's luscious voice via more-than-would-be-expected acoustic and natural instruments. These actual instrumental performances were recorded first, then heavily manipulated in an editing stage, giving the duo their own process and thus, their own sound. This approach made their music lush, dynamic, and more earthy when compared to typical electronic/dance and canned pop.\n\nIn November 2017, it was announced that Heap and Sigsworth would be reuniting to tour as Frou Frou in conjunction with an Imogen Heap solo tour in 2018. The duo released a live recording of \"Guitar Song\" on April 19, 2019. \"Guitar Song\" is one of two singles not released at the time of the band's initial break-up. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frou+Frou\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Blane Muise (born May 4, 1993), better known by her stage name Shygirl, is an English rapper, DJ, singer, songwriter and co-head/founder of record label and collective Nuxxe. Shygirl's music incorporates elements of hip house, industrial hip-hop, grime and deconstructed club. She has also been associated with the hyperpop music scene. Shygirl rose to prominence after working with close collaborator and friend Sega Bodega, as well as other well-known experimental pop producers Arca and Sophie, and gaining attention from the likes of Rihanna, who has used various Nuxxe tracks for her Fenty Beauty commercials and fashion shows. Shygirl has released various singles since 2016, and two EPs titled Cruel Practice and Alias. Her debut studio album Nymph was released on September 30, 2022.\n\nShygirl was born in South London and grew up around Blackheath. She is of Grenadian descent. She describes herself as a \"total homebody\" and \"delving into fantasy and reading constantly\" growing up. She was her secondary school's head girl. She went on to study practical photography at the University of Bristol, travelling back to London on the weekends for parties.\n\nShygirl released her first single \"Want More\", produced by Sega Bodega in 2016. This was the first song released on the Nuxxe label, founded by Shygirl, Sega Bodega and Coucou Chloe. She went on to work with Sega Bodega on her singles \"Msry\" and \"Nvr\" in 2017, having featured on his song \"CC\" earlier in the year. In 2018, Shygirl quit her day job at a modelling agency to pursue her music career.\n\nIn May 2018, Shygirl released her debut EP, Cruel Practice, on Nuxxe. The EP received positive reviews from Pitchfork, Crack Magazine and Tiny Mix Tapes.\n\nShe featured on Arca's song \"Watch\" on her 2020 album, Kick I. The pair had previously collaborated on the song \"Unconditional\", with all of the proceeds from that single going towards Black Lives Matter and Inquest UK. In November 2020, she released her second EP, Alias on the Because Music label. This EP received positive attention from Pitchfork, Vogue and NME. Alias was listed as one of the best EPs of 2020 by audio and music publication MusicNGear.\n\nIn June 2021, Shygirl released a performance film titled \"Blu\". It featured performances of songs from her Alias EP, as well as a new song, titled \"BDE\" featuring British rapper Slowthai. She released the song as a single the next day. She would later release the BDE 3XL remix EP in September. Shygirl and British producer Mura Masa were additionally featured on a remix of Lady Gaga and Blackpink's \"Sour Candy\" on Gaga's Dawn of Chromatica remix album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/ShyGirl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The singer combines poisonous lyricism with industrial rhythms boiling with tar to inhabit a fierce, sexual, pathologically impatient and deeply cathartic alter ego.\n\nShe recently explained that her nickname Shygirl has nothing to do with shyness. The alter ego that Muise dwells in on her debut solo EP of hers, Cruel Practice, isn't afraid to reach out to others, just \"she's not up for small talk.\" In the world of Shygirl, \"time is precious.\" She hates when people waste theirs, and she shows herself in a dark, seething character that combines poisonous lyricism with boiling industrial rhythms. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Shygirl/Cruel+Practice\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Woe (I See It From Your Side) - Björk Remix\", or simply \"Woe (Björk Remix)\", is the second collaboration by Shygirl and Björk, after \"Ovule (Shygirl & Sega Bodega Remix)\", released on March 21st, 2023. It is featured on the deluxe edition of her debut album, Nymph_o. Björk was supposed to be in the original track. but due to unknown reasons, she was removed from it and released with Shygirl's vocals only.\nOn the song's release day, Björk talked about it on her Facebook:\n\n\"SHYGIRL told me in her lyric she is talking about both different amorous interests and fame\nand how suddenly everyone wants something from you and you should be thrilled but you´re not …\n\nand i decided to take an angle as an older “amour” and give advice … because in “woe” she is asking a question .\nand i decided to reply to it from the SUFI angle which is : enjoy the wanting and the longing and NOT getting what you want but enjoy wanting it …\nhow the whirling dervishes reach up when they turn , it is meant to represent that longing and being content with that …\nalso on a more everyday personal level it is about sometimes when you are not satisfied in a relationship , you should not expect your partner to heal that or fix that … rather look at him or her as a partner in crime or a fellow-not-getter …. another human with that insatiable longing\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/ShyGirl/_/Woe+(I+See+It+From+Your+Side)+-+Bj%C3%B6rk+Remix\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"IT GIRL\" is the debut single by American social media personality Aliyah's Interlude. It was produced by Lxnely Beats and released on September 30, 2023, through Interlude Records. The pop-house song garnered success on TikTok upon its release and soundtracked more than 990,000 videos on the platform as of November 2023.\n\nBefore the release of \"IT GIRL\", Aliyah's Interlude had become popular on TikTok for her fashion style, which became known as AliyahCore. She was inspired by listening to Beyoncé's 2022 album Renaissance and her love of house music to \"hop on a house beat\". After finding one on YouTube, she recorded a rap over it and, after finding the Instagram account of its producer, Lxnely Beats, paid him for exclusive rights to it. Upon the release of \"IT GIRL\" on September 30, 2023, it went viral on TikTok, soundtracking more than 912,000 videos by November 2023.\n\nThe pop-house song features her rapping about being an \"it girl\", spelling the phrase out in its chorus, over a \"booming\" house beat. For Girls United, Kenyatta Victoria described her energy on the song as \"bubbly yet cocky\", while Moises Mendez II of Time called the song \"bouncy\" and compared her flow on it to that of rappers Azealia Banks and Nicki Minaj.\n\n#ALIYAHCORE #itgirl <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Aliyah%27s+Interlude/_/IT+GIRL\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "\nThe Mild High Club is a psychedelic pop group helmed by Alexander Brettin, a Los Angeles-based musician who originally hailed from Chicago. The group’s sound is pleasantly woozy and laid-back, but shows a subtle attention to detail without being excessive or indulgent. Brettin began working on Mild High Club material in 2012 by himself, using guitars, keyboards, computers, and a 4-track recorder, and shuttling between Chicago, Baltimore, and Los Angeles. Along the way, he met several musicians across the nation who contributed to his album and backed him up during live gigs. Mild High Club signed to Stones Throw at the end of 2014, and a 7″ single, “Windowpane,” was released in early 2015. The group’s debut album, Timeline, appeared later in the year on the label’s newly formed Circle Star Records imprint. ~ Paul Simpson\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mild+High+Club\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Praise Jah in the Moonlight\" is a song by YG Marley, released as his debut single on December 27, 2023. It was co-written by Marley with his mother Lauryn Hill, and samples his grandfather Bob Marley's 1978 song \"Crisis\" performed with The Wailers. It charted internationally, charting the highest in New Zealand at number one.\n\nIn late 2023, Marley performed the song at several of his mother Lauryn Hill's concerts, which led to the song gaining popularity on TikTok and fans asking for an official release of the song, which occurred on December 27, 2023. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/YG+Marley/_/Praise+Jah+in+the+Moonlight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "name": "Lou Reed",
        "bio": "Lewis Allan Reed (March 2, 1942 – October 27, 2013) was an American musician, songwriter, and poet. He was the guitarist, singer, and principal songwriter for the rock band the Velvet Underground and had a solo career that spanned five decades. Although not commercially successful during its existence, the Velvet Underground became regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of underground and alternative rock music. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic and transgressive lyrics, and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.\n\nHaving played guitar and sung in doo-wop groups in high school, Reed studied poetry at Syracuse University under Delmore Schwartz, and had served as a radio DJ, hosting a late-night avant garde music program while at college. After graduating from Syracuse, he went to work for Pickwick Records in New York City, a low-budget record company that specialized in sound-alike recordings, as a songwriter and session musician. A fellow session player at Pickwick was John Cale; together with Sterling Morrison and Angus MacLise, they would form the Velvet Underground in 1965. After building a reputation on the avant garde music scene, they gained the attention of Andy Warhol, who became the band's manager; they in turn became something of a fixture at The Factory, Warhol's art studio, and served as his \"house band\" for various projects. The band released their first album, now with drummer Moe Tucker and featuring German singer Nico, in 1967, and parted ways with Warhol shortly thereafter. Following several lineup changes and three more little-heard albums, Reed quit the band in 1970.\n\nAfter leaving the band, Reed would go on to a much more commercially successful solo career, releasing twenty solo studio albums. His second, Transformer (1972), was produced by David Bowie and arranged by Mick Ronson, and brought him mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the glam rock genre, anchored by Reed's most successful single, \"Walk on the Wild Side\". After Transformer, the less commercial but critically acclaimed Berlin peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. Rock 'n' Roll Animal (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and Sally Can't Dance (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard 200; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with The Blue Mask (1982) and New Sensations (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album New York.\n\nReed participated in the re-formation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with John Cale titled Songs for Drella which was a tribute to their former mentor Andy Warhol. Magic and Loss (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.\n\nHe contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled The Raven. He married his third wife Laurie Anderson in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album Lulu with Metallica. He died in 2013 of liver disease. Reed has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice; as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996 and as a solo act in 2015.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed\n\nStudio albums\nLou Reed (1972)\nTransformer (1972)\nBerlin (1973)\nRock 'n' Roll Animal (1974)\nSally Can't Dance (1974)\nMetal Machine Music (1975)\nConey Island Baby (1975)\nRock and Roll Heart (1976)\nStreet Hassle (1978)\nThe Bells (1979)\nGrowing Up in Public (1980)\nThe Blue Mask (1982)\nLegendary Hearts (1983)\nNew Sensations (1984)\nMistrial (1986)\nNew York (1989)\nMagic and Loss (1992)\nSet the Twilight Reeling (1996)\nEcstasy (2000)\nThe Raven (2003)\nHudson River Wind Meditations (2007) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "artist": "Lou Reed",
                "description": "Transformer is the second solo studio album by American recording artist Lou Reed. Produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, the album was released in November 1972 by RCA Records. It is considered an influential landmark of the glam rock genre, anchored by Reed's most successful single, \"Walk on the Wild Side\", which touched on then-controversial topics of sexual orientation, gender identity, prostitution, and drug use. Though Reed's self-titled debut solo album had been unsuccessful, Bowie had been an early fan of Reed's former band The Velvet Underground, and used his own fame to promote Reed, who had not yet achieved mainstream success.\n\nAs with its predecessor Lou Reed, Transformer contains songs Reed composed while in the Velvet Underground (here, four out of eleven). \"Andy's Chest\" was first recorded by the band in 1969 and \"Satellite of Love\" demoed in 1970; these versions were released on VU and Peel Slowly and See, respectively. For Transformer, the original up-tempo pace of these songs was slowed down.\n\n\"New York Telephone Conversation\" and \"Goodnight Ladies\" were played live during the band's summer 1970 residency at Max's Kansas City; the latter takes its title refrain from the last line of the second section (\"A Game of Chess\") of T. S. Eliot's modernist poem, The Waste Land: \"Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night\", which is itself a quote from Ophelia in Hamlet.\n\nAs in Reed's Velvet Underground days, the connection to artist Andy Warhol remained strong. According to Reed, Warhol told him he should write a song about someone vicious. When Reed asked what he meant by vicious, Warhol replied, \"Oh, you know, like I hit you with a flower\", resulting in the song \"Vicious\".\n\nTransformer was produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, both of whom had been strongly influenced by Reed's work with the Velvet Underground. Bowie had obliquely referenced the Velvet Underground in the cover notes for his album Hunky Dory and regularly performed both \"White Light/White Heat\" and \"I'm Waiting for the Man\" in concerts and on the BBC during 1971–1973. He even began recording \"White Light/White Heat\" for inclusion on Pin Ups, but it was never completed; Ronson ended up using the backing track for his solo album Play Don't Worry in 1974.\n\nMick Ronson (who was at the time the lead guitarist with Bowie's band, the Spiders from Mars) played a major role in the recording of the album at Trident Studios, London, serving as the co-producer and primary session musician (contributing guitar, piano, recorder and backing vocals), as well as arranger, contributing the string arrangement for \"Perfect Day\". Reed lauded Ronson's contribution in the Transformer episode of the documentary series Classic Albums, praising the beauty of his work and keeping down the vocal to highlight the strings. The songs on the album are now among Reed's best-known works, including \"Walk on the Wild Side\", \"Perfect Day\" and \"Satellite of Love\", and the album's commercial success elevated him from cult status to become an international star.\n\nThe cover art was from a Mick Rock photograph that inadvertently became over-exposed as he was printing it in the darkroom. Rock noticed the flaw but decided he liked the fortuitous effect enough to submit the image for the album cover.\n\nAccording to Rock, \"When I showed Lou the contact sheets, he zeroed in on the transformer shot. I made the print myself – as I usually did in those days. The first test I made fell out of focus in the exposure. Lou loved the result. It took me twelve attempts to reproduce this accident for the final larger print for the album cover\".\n\nKarl Stoecker (who also shot the first three Roxy Music album covers) took the back cover photo of a woman and a man. The woman is 1960s London supermodel Gala Mitchel. The man is portrayed by Ernie Thormahlen (a friend of Reed). The man appears to have a noticeable erection, although Reed has said this was actually a banana which Thormahlen had stuffed down his jeans before the photo shoot.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Walk on the Wild Side\", became an international success, despite its controversial subject matter. The song's lyrics mention transgender issues, sex acts, and drugs, causing it to be edited in some countries and banned in others. It is now generally regarded by fans and critics as Reed's signature tune. \"Satellite of Love\" was issued as the second single in February 1973. In 2002, a 30th anniversary edition of the album was released; in addition to demos of \"Hangin' Round\" and \"Perfect Day\", it includes a hidden track featuring an advert for the album. Following Reed's death in October 2013, digital sales of Transformer, \"Walk on the Wild Side\", and \"Perfect Day\" all rose more than 300%, and \"Walk on the Wild Side\" cracked the new Billboard Rock Digital Songs chart at No. 38.\n\nIn a mixed review for Rolling Stone, Nick Tosches noted the songs \"Satellite of Love\", \"Vicious\", \"Walk on the Wild Side\" and \"Hangin' 'Round\" which he felt expressed a stimulating sexuality saying \"Reed himself says he thinks the album's great. I don’t think it's nearly as good as he's capable of doing. He seems to have the abilities to come up with some really dangerous, powerful music, stuff that people like Jagger and Bowie have only rubbed knees with.\" In a retrospective review for The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Tom Hull remarked that Reed \"wrote a bunch of clever new songs and tried to cash in on producer David Bowie's trendily androgynous glam rock, which worked well enough to break 'Walk on the Wild Side.'\"\n\nIn 1997, Transformer was named the 44th greatest album of all time in a \"Music of the Millennium\" poll conducted in the United Kingdom by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 2000, it was voted number 58 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. Transformer is also ranked at number 55 on NME's list of \"Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2003, the album was ranked at number 194 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and is ranked 109 on the 2020 list. It is also on Q magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Albums Ever\".\n\nIn 2018, 33⅓ published a book by musician Ezra Furman about Transformer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed/Transformer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "The album is a tragic rock opera about a doomed couple, and addresses themes of drug use and depression. Upon its release, the response of fans and critics was not positive as many were expecting another upbeat glam outing. Despite lukewarm reviews the album reached #7 in the UK album chart (Reed's best achievement there). Poor sales in the US (#98) and harsh criticism made Reed feel disillusioned about the album and in subsequent years he rarely played any Berlin material in his live shows. Over time many have come to consider Berlin to be among Lou Reed's best studio albums as a solo artist.\nMusically, Berlin differs greatly from the bulk of Reed's work, due to the use of heavy orchestral arrangements, horns, and top session musicians. Instrumentally, Reed himself only contributes acoustic guitar.\n\"The Kids\" tells of Caroline having her children taken from her by the authorities, and features the sounds of children shouting for their mother. The Waterboys take their name from a line in this song.\nAs with Reed's previous two studio albums, Berlin re-drafts several songs that had been written and recorded previously. The title track first appeared on Reed's solo debut album, only here it is lyrically simplified, the key changed, and re-arranged for piano. \"Oh, Jim\" makes use of the Velvet Underground outtake, \"Oh, Gin\". \"Caroline Says (II)\" is a rewrite of \"Stephanie Says\" from VU. The Velvets had also recorded a rather sedate demo of \"Sad Song\", which had much milder lyrics in its original form. \"Men of Good Fortune\" had also been played by the Velvets as early as 1966; an archival CD featuring live performances of the band playing at Andy Warhol's Factory provides the evidence of the song's age. The CD featuring the early performance of \"Men of Good Fortune\" is not for sale and can only be heard at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed/Berlin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "New York is the fifteenth solo studio album by American musician Lou Reed, released in January 1989 by Sire Records.\n\nThe album received universal critical acclaim upon release, and is widely considered to be among Reed's strongest solo efforts. It is highly regarded for the strength and force of its lyrical content; Reed stated that he required simple music so that it would not distract from his frank lyrics. The single \"Dirty Blvd.\" was a number-one hit on the newly created Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart for four weeks.\n\nReed's former band, the Velvet Underground, were at the peak of their cult popularity in the late 1980s, but his solo career had hit several lows during the 1980s. The widespread popularity of New York reignited his career to the extent the Velvet Underground were revived for a world tour.\n\nVelvet Underground drummer Moe Tucker played percussion on two tracks.\n\nReed's straightforward rock and roll sound on this album was unusual for the time and along with other releases such as Graham Parker's The Mona Lisa's Sister presaged a back-to-basics turn in mainstream rock music. Conversely, the lyrics through the 14 songs are profuse and carefully woven, making New York Reed's most overtly conceptual album since the early 1970s. His polemical liner notes direct the listener to hear the 57-minute album in one sitting, \"as though it were a book or a movie.\" The lyrics vent anger at many public figures in the news at the time. Reed mentions by name the Virgin Mary, the NRA, Rudy Giuliani, \"the President\", \"the mayor\", the \"Statue of Bigotry\", Buddha, Mike Tyson, Bernard Goetz, Donald Trump, \"Mr. Waldheim\", \"the Pontiff\", Jesse Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Swaggart, Louis Farrakhan, Oliver North, Richard Secord (misidentified as \"William Secord\"), and Morton Downey.\n\nReed also drew inspiration from some of his friends and fellow artists. For instance, in the song \"Last Great American Whale\", Reed quotes John Mellencamp, referring to him as \"my painter friend Donald.\" Upon hearing the album, Mellencamp himself said, \"Yeah, it sounds like it was produced by an eighth-grader, but I like it.\"\n\nThe cover art is a photograph with five different shots of Reed superimposed on the same street scene. The photo is a blue monochrome apart from the shoes/boots which are brown, the colors do seem to vary across different pressings/issues. The rear photo is the same street scene without Reed. The street is lit from the right hand side, while the photos of Reed are all lit from the left. Photography is credited to Waring Abbott. The album design was done by Spencer Drate, Judith Salavetz, and Sylvia Reed. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed/New+York\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Metal Machine Music (sometimes abbreviated MMM) is an album by Lou Reed. It was originally released as a two-disc LP by RCA Records in 1975. It was reissued on a single compact disc by BMG in 1998 and again by Buddah Records in 2000.\nAs a radical departure from the rest of Reed's catalog, Metal Machine Music is generally considered to be either a joke, a grudging fulfillment of a contractual obligation, or an early example of noise music. Reed himself has said of the album \"I was serious about it. I was also really, really stoned.\". In the album's liner notes he claimed to have invented heavy metal music and asserted that Metal Machine Music was the ultimate conclusion of that genre. Despite Reed's artistic seriousness, his decision to release Metal Machine Music may have been a reluctant rejoinder to his contractual obligations with RCA.\n\nStyle\n\nAccording to Reed (despite the original liner notes), the album entirely consists of guitar feedback played at different speeds. The two guitars were tuned in unusual ways and played with different reverb levels. He would then place the guitars in front of their amplifiers, and the feedback from the very large amps would vibrate the strings - the guitars were, effectively, playing themselves. He recorded the work on a four-track tape recorder in his New York apartment, mixing the four tracks for stereo. In its original form, each track occupied one side of an LP record and lasted exactly 16:01 minutes. The fourth side ended in a locked groove that caused the last 1.8 seconds of music to repeat endlessly. The rare 8-track tape version has no silence in between programs, so that it plays continuously without gaps on most players.\nA major influence on Reed's recording, and an important source for an understanding of its seriousness, was the mid-1960s work of La Monte Young's Theater of Eternal Music (whose members included John Cale, Tony Conrad, Angus Maclise and Marian Zazeela). Both Cale and Maclise were also members of The Velvet Underground (Maclise left before the group began recording). The Theater of Eternal Music's discordant sustained notes and loud amplification had influenced Cale's subsequent contribution to the Velvet Underground in his use of both discordance and feedback. Recent releases of works by Cale and Conrad from the mid-sixities, such as Cale's Inside the Dream Syndicate series (The Dream Syndicate being the alternative name given by Cale and Conrad to their collective work with Young) testify to the influence this important mid-sixties experimental work had on Reed ten years later.\nIn an interview with rock journalist Lester Bangs, Reed claimed that he had intentionally placed sonic allusions to classical works such Beethoven's Eroica and Pastoral Symphonies in the distortion, and that he had attempted to have the album released on RCA's Red Seal classical label; however, it is not clear if he was being serious, though he has repeated the latter claim in a recent interview.\n\nCritical reception\n\nOn its release, it was reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine as sounding like \"the tubular groaning of a galactic refrigerator\" and as displeasing to experience as \"a night in a bus terminal\". In the 1979 Rolling Stone Record Guide, critic Billy Altman said it was \"a two-disc set consisting of nothing more than ear-wrecking electronic sludge, guaranteed to clear any room of humans in record time.\" (This aspect of the album is referenced in the Bruce Sterling short story Dori Bangs.) However, the first issue of the seminal New York zine Punk, placed Reed and the album on its inaugural 1976 issue, presaging the advent of both Punk and the discordance of the New York No Wave scene. To quote critic Victor Bockris Reed's recording can be understood as \"the ultimate conceptual punk album and the progenitor of New York punk rock.\" The album was ranked number two in the 1991 book The Worst Rock 'n' Roll Records of All Time by Jimmy Guterman and Owen O'Donnell.  Only Elvis Presley's concert byplay album Having Fun With Elvis On Stage ranked worse. The book gives sympathy to legendary record cutting engineer Bob Ludwig for having to listen to the album in its entirety. (In fact, according to the liner notes of the 2000 reissue of the album, Ludwig was \"totally into what Lou was doing\" and compared the work to that of avant-garde classical composers Iannis Xenakis and Karlheinz Stockhausen.) In 2005, Q magazine included the album in a list of \"Ten Terrible Records by Great Artists\", and it ranked number four in Q's fifty worst albums of all time list.\nProbably the most sympathetic appraisal of Metal Machine Music was given by rock critic Lester Bangs, who wrote that \"as classical music it adds nothing to a genre that may well be depleted. As rock 'n' roll it's interesting garage electronic rock 'n' roll. As a statement it's great, as a giant FUCK YOU it shows integrity—a sick, twisted, dunced-out, malevolent, perverted, psychopathic integrity, but integrity nevertheless.\" Bangs later wrote a tongue-in-cheek article on Metal Machine Music titled \"The Greatest Album Ever Made\", in which he judged it \"the greatest record ever made in the history of the human eardrum. Number Two: Kiss Alive!\"\nDespite the intensive criticism (or perhaps because of the exposure it generated), Metal Machine Music reportedly sold 100,000 copies in the US according to the liner notes of the Buddah Records CD issue.\n\nInfluence\n\nToday the record is seen as an early form of ambient music and a defining pillar of the noise music and industrial music movements.\n\n\nReferences in music\n\nOn their 1985 album Bad Moon Rising, Sonic Youth used samples from it in the songs \"Brave Men Run (In My Family)\" and \"Society Is A Hole.\" Metal Machine Music was highly influential on Sonic Youth member Lee Ranaldo's solo endeavors, particularly his 1987 album From Here to Infinity, composed entirely of tape loops, feedback, and lock grooves.\nThe influential German industrial rock band Die Krupps released the anthology \"Metall Maschinen Musik\" in 1991 and the single \"Metal Machine Music\" in 1992. The group's singer, Jürgen Engler, stated that the term \"metal music\" was invented by Lou Reed on Metal Machine Music. Engler has cited Lou Reed as one of his influences. \nJapanese noise artist Merzbow is heavily influenced by this album, even titling his first released cassette Metal Acoustic Music.\nNoise-sculpting band Bailter Space referenced the album in the lyric, \"Flying over Pacific Seas in a burning metal machine\" in the song \"Make\", on their album Robot World.\nDavid Bowie referenced the album in an article for Rolling Stone; the article listed Nine Inch Nails as one of music's \"Immortals\", and described in part a dream Bowie had about attending a birthday dinner for Lou Reed: \"The music is a birthday surprise for Lou. Trent Reznor remixed this version of Metal Machine Music as a present.\"\nTV on the Radio use extended samples of the album for the verses of \"Let the Devil In\" from their 2006 album Return to Cookie Mountain.\nMetal Machine Music was presented at the Kunstlerhaus art center in Stuttgart as a sound installation in 1999, curated by the artist and then director, Fareed Armaly.\nThe German new music ensemble Zeitkratzer have played Metal Machine Music in concert, with Lou Reed as soloist, using traditional classical concert instruments from a score transcribed from the original recording. A CD was released in September 2007.\nIn 2002 Ulrich Maiss aka Cellectric premiered a solo cello version of Metal Machine Music entitled \"CelloMachine\". Lou Reed on CelloMachine (in an interview on CBC, October 2004): „ If you ever saw what Ulrich's doing you would, you know, open a fan club for him.  It’s like a rock approach to the cello - if you thought of the cello as a guitar with a feedback: off you go!\"\nA small part of the album is used in the anime Boogiepop Phantom.\nThe Killers song 'Tranquilize', released Oct 2007 and involving Lou Reed, begins in a manner very similar to a section of Metal Machine Music\nBrian Eno wrote about the album in his 1995 diary: \"His Metal machine music was released the same week - twenty years ago - as Discreet Music. Discreet Music soft, calm, melodic and reassuringly repetitive, without a single sound other than tape hiss about 1500 Hz, whereas MMM is as abrasive and unmelodic as possible, with almost nothing below - and yet they occupy two ends of what was at the time a pretty new axis - music as immersion, as sonic experience in which you float.

Records in the United States and Vertigo Records elsewhere. The album is the final full-length studio recording project that Reed was involved in before his death in October 2013. It was recorded in San Rafael, California, during April to June 2011, after Reed had played with Metallica at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 25th Anniversary Concert which led to them wanting to collaborate. The lead single, titled \"The View\", was released on September 27, 2011.\n\nLulu is a double album that, conceptually, is based on the two \"Lulu plays\" by the German playwright Frank Wedekind (1864–1918). The majority of composition is centered on spoken word delivered by Reed over instrumentals composed by Metallica, with occasional backing vocals provided by Metallica lead vocalist James Hetfield. Reed wrote the majority of the lyrics. The album was released worldwide on October 31, 2011, and on November 1 in North America. Upon its release, Lulu received polarized reviews, and an extremely negative response from many fans and several prominent critics. As of March 2023, Lulu has sold 280,000 copies worldwide. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed/Lulu\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "description": "Rock n Roll Animal is a live album by Lou Reed, released in 1974. In its original form, it features five songs from different periods of his creative career, including several songs by the Velvet Underground. The songs are all re-arranged into a powerful hard rock set. The musicians were Pentti Glan (drums) and Prakash John (bass), Ray Colcord (keyboards), and Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter on guitars (the two guitarists would later form the second Alice Cooper band, first on Welcome to My Nightmare, which also featured Glan, Colcord and Prakash John). The album was recorded live on December 21, 1973, at Howard Stein's Academy of Music in New York.\n\nA remastered version was released on CD in 2000. It featured two tracks not included on the original LP or 1990 CD release.\n\nFurther excerpts from the same concert were released in 1975 as Lou Reed Live (between the remastered Rock 'n' Roll Animal and Lou Reed Live the entire show has been released, albeit in a different order than the original concert). This live album's stereo mix differs from its counterpart in that guitarist Dick Wagner is heard on the left channel, and Steve Hunter is on the right; this arrangement is reversed on Rock 'n' Roll Animal. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed/Rock+n+Roll+Animal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Walk on the Wild Side\" is a Lou Reed song from his 1972 second solo album Transformer. It was produced by David Bowie. The song received wide radio coverage, despite its touching on taboo topics such as transsexuality, drugs, male prostitutes and oral sex. In the United States, RCA released an edited version of the song as a single which eliminated the song's reference to oral sex.\nThe lyrics, describing a series of individuals and their journeys to New York City, refer to several of the regular \"superstars\" at Andy Warhol's New York studio, The Factory, namely Holly Woodlawn, Candy Darling, Joe Dallesandro, Jackie Curtis and Joe Campbell (referred to in the song by his nickname Sugar Plum Fairy). Candy Darling was also the subject of Reed's earlier song for The Velvet Underground, Candy Says.\n\nThe saxophone solo played over the fadeout of the song was performed by Ronnie Ross, who had taught David Bowie to play the saxophone during Bowie's childhood.\nThe backing vocals were sung by Thunderthighs, a girl group that included founder Dari Lallou together with Karen Friedman, Jacki Campbell and Casey Synge.\nThe single peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts in early 1973.\n\nLike many of Reed's songs, \"Walk On The Wild Side\" is based on a plagal cadence, alternating from C to F. The F is played as a sixth chord. The pre-chorus introduces the major second, D Major, although in some live performances this was changed to D minor, resulting in a completely diatonic song.\nThe song is also noted for its twin interlocking bass lines played by Herbie Flowers on double bass and overdubbed fretless bass guitar. In an interview on BBC Radio 4 (\"Playing Second Fiddle\", aired July 2005), Flowers claimed that the reason he came up with the twin bass line was that as a session musician he would be paid double for playing two instruments on the same track.\n\nIn the 2001 documentary Classic Albums: Lou Reed: Transformer, Reed says that it was Nelson Algren's 1956 novel, A Walk on the Wild Side, that was the launching point for the song, even though, as it grew, the song became inhabited by characters from his own life. As with several other Reed songs from the 1970s, the title may also be an allusion to an earlier song, in this case Mack David and Elmer Bernstein's song of the same name, the Academy Award-nominated title song of the 1962 film based on Algren's novel.[citation needed] During his performance of the song on his 1978 Live: Take No Prisoners album, Reed humorously explains the song's development from a request that he wrote the music for the never completed musical version of Algren's novel.\n\nHip hop group A Tribe Called Quest also sampled the song, on their 1991 single \"Can I Kick It?\".\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed/_/Walk+on+the+Wild+Side\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "A song written by Lou Reed in 1972. Its fame was given a boost in the 1990s when it was featured in the 1996 film Trainspotting, and after its release as a charity single in 1997.\n\nThe song was originally featured on the 1972 album Transformer. The song's lyrics are often considered to suggest simple, conventional romantic devotion, possibly alluding to Reed’s relationship with Bettye Kronstadt (soon to become his first wife) and Reed’s own conflicts with his sexuality, drug use and ego.\n\nHowever, on a deeper reading of the song's lyrics, amongst the idealized description of a \"perfect day\", interposed lines such as \"You just keep me hanging on\", and \"I thought I was someone else, someone good\" suggest a far deeper yearning than just the superficial romantic clichés, and allude to the underlying and painful bitterness of nostalgia often felt even as an event is lived - an event one knows or fears to be a mere distraction or illusion. The repeated last line 'You`re going to reap just what you sow' is very similar to Galatians 6:7.\n\nSome commentators have further seen the lyrics as displaying Reed's romanticised attitude towards a period of his own addiction to heroin. Critics of this view assert that Reed never tried to conceal his drug use, so the song does not have concealed meanings of this nature.\n\nThe song was featured on an AT&T commercial featuring snowboarder Gretchen Bleiler that ran during the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed/_/Perfect+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Satellite of Love\" is one of Lou Reed's best-known songs from his solo career. It is the second single from his 1972 album Transformer. At the time of its release, it achieved minor chart success, though it later became a staple of his concerts and compilation albums.\n\n\"Satellite of Love\" first started off as a song that Reed originally composed in 1970 while he was still a member of The Velvet Underground. In a 2005 interview with Velvet Underground member Doug Yule, Yule recalled Reed first mentioning the song to him in the Summer of 1970 while he was riding in the back of a limousine with Reed and Steve Sesnick: \"Steve [Sesnick] was there going on about \"how we needed airplay\", and Lou said \"I have this song \"Satellite of Love\", and he mentioned the satellite that had just gone up which was a big deal in the news at the time, cause the space race was happening, and Steve Sesnick said \"Yeah, yeah – that'll do it!\" While the band soon recorded a demo track of the song in the Summer of 1970 during the sessions for Loaded, the song didn't make the final album.\n\nLyrically, the song is about a man who observes a satellite launch on television and contemplates what Reed describes as feelings of \"the worst kind of jealousy\" about his unfaithful girlfriend. The chorus is:\n\nI watched it for a little while\nI love to watch things on TV\nSatellite of love\nSatellite of love\n\nDavid Bowie, who produced the album, can be heard providing background vocals, especially at the final chorus. Reed would write later: \"He has a melodic sense that's just well above anyone else in rock & roll. Most people could not sing some of his melodies. He can really go for a high note. Take 'Satellite of Love,' on my Transformer album. There's a part at the very end where his voice goes all the way up. It's fabulous.\"\n\nThe existence of the original Velvet Underground version was largely unknown until the release of the box set Peel Slowly and See in 1995, and it also appears on the 1997 Rhino Records 2-CD version of the Loaded album.\n\nIn addition to being more up-tempo, the VU version contains a significant change in the lyrics. The lines:\n\nI've been told that you've been bold\nWith Harry, Mark, and John\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday to Thursday\nWith Harry, Mark, and John\n\nwere originally recorded as:\n\nI've been told baby you've been bold\nWith Winkin, Blinkin, and Nod\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday to Thursday\nTo Winkin, Blinkin, and Nod\n\nOn the original lyrics, Reed said, \"Jesus. Best left forgotten. Obviously, I didn't want to use real names yet. I probably wanted to make sure I wasn't using a name that really meant something to me.\"\n\nThis song is also featured on the soundtrack of the film, Adventureland (2009). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Lou+Reed/_/Satellite+of+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "(1934-1954)\n\nThe Ink Spots were a vocal group in the 1930s and 1940s that helped define the musical genre that led to rhythm and blues and rock and roll, and the subgenre doo-wop. They gained much acceptance in both the white community and black community largely due to the ballad style introduced to the group by lead singer Bill Kenny. They were inducted into the Rock & Roll hall of fame in 1999.\n\nTheir songs usually began with a guitar riff, followed by the tenor Bill Kenny, who sang the whole song through. After Kenny finished singing, the bass would either recite the first half, or the bridge of the song, or would speak the words, almost in a free form, that were not part of the song, commonly using the words \"Honey Child\", or \"Honey Babe\", expressing his love for his darling in the song. This was followed by Kenny, who finished up singing the last refrain or the last half of the song. On some songs Deek Watson would sing the lead rather than Bill Kenny. This was mostly on the uptempo \"Jive\" songs.\n\nThe Ink Spots formed in the early 1930s in Indianapolis. The founding members were :-\n\nOrville \"Hoppy\" Jones (b. 17 February 1902, Chicago, Illinois – d. 18 October 1944, New York City) (bass) (Played cello in the manner of a stand up bass)[1]\nIvory \"Deek\" Watson (b. 18 July 1909, Mounds, Illinois – d. 4 November 1969, Washington, D.C.) (tenor) (Played guitar and trumpet)\nJerry Daniels (b. 14 December 1915 – d. 7 November 1995, Indianapolis, Indiana) (tenor) (Played guitar and ukulele)\nCharlie Fuqua (b. 20 October 1910 – d. 21 December 1971, New Haven, Connecticut) \n(baritone) (Played guitar)\n\n*** BILL KENNY ***\nThe voice that made them famous Bill Kenny (Mr. Ink Spot) was born June 12th 1914 in Philadelphia PA, and died Mar 23rd 1978 in New West Minister, British Columbia. When Bill Kenny joined the group in 1936 they were mostly a \"Jive\" ensemble, performing swinging uptempo songs. It wasn't until The Ink Spots 1939 recording of \"If I Didn't Care\" that Bill Kenny's voice began being regularly featured on Ballads, which it was until The Ink Spots disbanded in 1954. Hits that feature Bill Kenny include \"I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire\", \"We Three\", \"The Gypsy\", \"Address Unknown\", \"With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming\", \"So Sorry\", \"Bless You\", \"My Prayer\", \"Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall\", \"It's A Sin To Tell A Lie\", It Isn't A Dream Anymore\", and dozens of others. Bill Kenny has been listed as an influence by such great artists as Elvis Presley, Sam Cooke, Johnny Mathis, Sonny Till, Clyde McPhatter and many others. Bill Kenny is often noted as the father of Doo Wop for his high tenor singing and his introduction of the popular \"Top & Bottom\" format used by virtually every Doo Wop group in the 50's and 60's. \n\nSince Bill Kenny broke up The Ink Spots in 1954 there have been well over 500 black vocal Quartets calling themselves The Ink Spots none of which have or had any original members. There are even groups still touring as The Ink Spots today. It is largely accepted that if the group didn't contain Bill Kenny then the group was/ is a fake. \n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Ink+Spots\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire\" is a pop song written by Bennie Benjamin, Eddie Durham, Sol Marcus and Eddie Seiler.\n\nIt was written in 1938, but was first recorded three years later by Harlan Leonard and His Rockets. It was covered by several musicians and groups, most successfully by Horace Heidt on Columbia Records, whose version reached number one on the US pop chart; and by The Ink Spots on Decca in 1941, whose version reached number four on the same listing. Other early versions included those by Tommy Tucker, Mitchell Ayres, and (in Britain) Vera Lynn. The song, with its open line \"I don't want to set the world on fire / I just want to start a flame in your heart...\" became especially popular after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.\n\nThe song was later recorded by Betty Carter, Frankie Laine, Brian Hyland, Anthony Newley, Suzy Bogguss and others.\n\nThe Ink Spots' 1941 version is featured in the Bethesda Softworks video games Fallout 3, Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 on the in-game radio.\n\nThe song was used in the trailer and in the second episode of the first season for the Fallout TV show. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ink+Spots/_/I+Don%27t+Want+to+Set+the+World+on+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Bill Kenny the 1st tenor by far had one of the purest tenor voices of all time. if you note when he hits the high notes C above High C he does not use a falsetto  like many singers especially tenors or other singers did like I had to do as baritone in order to reach the high notes nor did he slide up the scale to them he simply had the ability to reach right up and just nail them every time.\n\nThe rest of the group were also very good and they had a blend like no other in those early days when black quartettes were coming along and aren't we glad they did come along for all to enjoy..thanks\n\nLarry Adams\n Phoenix.AZ. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Ink+Spots/_/If+I+Didn%27t+Care\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "New West is a Toronto-based music collective formed in 2017. The group is comprised of four like-minded songwriters and instrumentalists from varying notable studio production and musical backgrounds: Kala Wita, Vella, Ben Key and Noel West.\n\nThe four members that make up New West met primarily through Noel. In 2017, Noel conducted separate studio sessions with Kala Wita, who was introduced to Noel via the Toronto music scene and childhood friend Ben Key with the intention of forming a collaborative project. The three inevitably started sessions together however it was the addition of Vella, friend and colleague to Ben, that completed the equation. The chemistry was instantaneous. In 2018, the group changed their name from The .wav to New West, ready to introduce a new signature sound to the Toronto music scene.\n\nAll music released by New West is written and performed by all four members. It is this characteristic that defines them as a collective and separates them from other artists and bands. Each member contributes as a multifaceted instrumentalist/songwriter, putting forth a fresh spin on collaborative music. The New West sound is comprised of a wide pallet of sonic inspirations but drawing primarily from British acts such as Oasis, Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and Toronto artists such as The Weeknd and Daniel Caesar. Their songs emanate themes of nostalgia, infatuation, heartbreak and self-awareness with a focus on songwriting and lyricism. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/New+West\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                "summary": "\"Next To You\" started off as just another love song but somehow found it’s place as a sort of ode to French romantic films. The song always felt very cinematic to me, I think we were really inspired by Sean Brown’s work on our short film. The European backdrop really brought the \"Call Me When You Hear This Song\" EP to life and the aesthetic eventually found its way back into the music. We loved the idea of a song set in a specific place and Paris just felt right.\n\nI think it’s important to seek inspiration from all art forms. Taking a scene from a film or a mood from a painting and flipping it into something musical is a practice that can sometimes lead to ideas that you wouldn’t otherwise think of.\"\n\n- via New West's Website <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/New+West/_/Next+to+You\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It’s a bit vengeful and mean, but also fun. Fuck it. Once I sent Naomi and Jo the demo they really took the cockiness in the lyric and vocal performance and carried it to the extreme with the production of the track. It became this super bombastic, Janet Jackson-era track. Ally Pankiw, who directed the music video with Taylor James, then came up with the idea of putting the music video in a criminal underworld, which we thought fit perfectly. Plus we wanted an excuse to dress Jo up like The Bear.“\n\n– Katie Gavin via DORK <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Muna/_/One+That+Got+Away\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio": "Shaggy is the name of, at least, two artists.\n1, Shaggy (born October 22, 1969, in Kingston, Jamaica as Orville Richard Burrell), is a Jamaican reggae artist who takes his nickname from his shaggy hair. He is especially notable for his distinctive sub-baritone voice.\n\nHis family immigrated to the United States and they settled in the neighborhood of Flatbush, Brooklyn, located in New York City, New York, USA.\n\nIn 1988, he joined the United States Marine Corps and served during Operation Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War.\n\nOn his return from Iraq, he decided to pursue his music career and his first hit in 1993: \"Oh Carolina\", was a dancehall re-make of a ska hit by the Folkes Brothers. The same year, Shaggy appeared on Kenny Dope's hip hop album \"The Unreleased Project\". He worked together with producers such as Sting Intl., Don One (who cut his first track), Lloyd 'Spiderman' Campbell and Robert Livingston. He had further big hits, including \"Boombastic\" in 1995.\n\nHe then had a major comeback in 2001, featuring worldwide number-one hit singles \"It Wasn't Me\" and \"Angel,\" the latter of which was built around Merrilee Rush's 1968 hit \"Angel of the Morning\" (which was remade in 1981 by Juice Newton). The album Hot Shot, from which those cuts came, would hit number one on the Billboard 200.\n\nHowever, his 2002 release Lucky Day, and the 2005 album Clothes Drop failed to match Hot Shot's success.\n\nShaggy performed the theme for Showtime (film), a 2002 movie.\n\n2, Shaggy, a swedish rock/blues rock band from the 1970's.

                "summary": "\"It Wasn't Me\" is a 2000 number one hit song by reggae artist Shaggy, featuring Ricardo \"RikRok\" Ducent. It achieved a huge success in many countries, topping the charts in the US, France, UK, the Netherlands, Australia and Ireland.\n\nThe song was originally never intended to be released as a single, MCA Records wanted \"Dance and Shout\" to be the first single released from the Hot Shot album and didn't offer other tracks to DJs. Hawaiian DJ Pablo Sato downloaded the album from \"a Napster-like MP3 site he won’t name\" and discovered it \"was the album’s standout cut.\" He played the song on the radio the next day. \"The phone lines lit up right away. Within a couple of days, it was our number-one requested song.\"\n\nThe lyrics depict one man (Rikrok) asking his friend (Shaggy) what to do after his girlfriend caught him with another woman. Shaggy's advice is to deny everything with the phrase \"It wasn't me\", despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\nTwo versions of the song and video exist: the radio and television edit version replace the lyric \"Picture this; we were both butt-naked banging on the bathroom floor\" with \"Picture this; we were both caught making love on the bathroom floor.\"\n\nThe song is particularly famous on the Case Western Reserve University campus for being played excessive amounts of times on the jukebox in the Leutner Commons Cafe.\n\n\n\nThe song was Shaggy's first number-one hit in the U.S., and the follow-up, \"Angel,\" also reached number one. The single also reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 4 March 2001, making the song a transatlantic chart topper. It also reached number one in Australia on April 1, 2001. It is also the 4th biggest selling single of the 21st century in the United Kingdom. Prior to this the song reached number 31 on import sales in the UK before its release. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Shaggy/_/It+Wasn%27t+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was re-recorded in 2000 with Samantha Cole's vocals after Jackson's label withheld the song from being included on Shaggy's next album. It was released on 31 May 2001 as the third official single from his 2000 album Hot Shot.\n\nBillboard changed its chart policies near the end of 1998, allowing tracks without a commercial release to chart on the Billboard charts. This resulted in \"Luv Me, Luv Me\" debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1998 due to airplay alone. It eventually peaked at number #76, ending Janet Jackson's record-breaking streak of 18 consecutive top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Shaggy/_/Luv+Me,+Luv+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
